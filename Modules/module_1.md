### **Module 1: The Mathematical and Programming Toolkit**

#### **Sub-topic 1.1: Statistics & Probability (Part 1: Descriptive Statistics)**

**Overview:**
Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. We're going to focus on measures of **Central Tendency** (where the data tends to cluster) and **Measures of Dispersion** (how spread out the data is).

---

#### **1. Measures of Central Tendency**

These statistics tell us about the center or typical value of a dataset.

##### **1.1. Mean (Arithmetic Mean)**

*   **Explanation:** The mean, often called the "average," is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It's the most common measure of central tendency.
*   **Intuition:** If you were to flatten out all the values in your dataset evenly, the mean would be the value each item would have. It represents the "balancing point" of the data.
*   **Mathematical Equation:**
    For a set of $n$ observations $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$:
    $$ \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$
    Where:
    *   $\bar{x}$ (read as "x-bar") is the sample mean.
    *   $\sum$ (sigma) denotes summation.
    *   $x_i$ is the $i$-th observation in the dataset.
    *   $n$ is the total number of observations.

*   **Example:** Consider a dataset of exam scores: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`
    *   Sum = $85 + 90 + 78 + 92 + 88 = 433$
    *   Number of scores ($n$) = $5$
    *   Mean = $433 / 5 = 86.6$

*   **Python Implementation:**

    Let's calculate the mean first manually using basic Python, then using the `numpy` library, which is optimized for numerical operations.

    ```python
    # Our dataset of exam scores
    exam_scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]

    # --- Manual Calculation ---
    sum_scores = sum(exam_scores)
    num_scores = len(exam_scores)
    mean_manual = sum_scores / num_scores
    print(f"Manual Mean: {mean_manual}")

    # --- Using NumPy ---
    import numpy as np

    mean_numpy = np.mean(exam_scores)
    print(f"NumPy Mean: {mean_numpy}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Manual Mean: 86.6
    NumPy Mean: 86.6
    ```

*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Pros:** Easy to calculate and understand, uses all data points.
    *   **Cons:** Highly sensitive to **outliers** (extreme values). A single very high or very low score can significantly pull the mean in that direction, making it less representative of the "typical" value. For example, if one score was 10, the mean would drop significantly.

##### **1.2. Median**

*   **Explanation:** The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values.
*   **Intuition:** The median divides the dataset into two equal halves: 50% of the data falls below the median, and 50% falls above it. It's truly the "middle" value.
*   **Mathematical Equation:**
    No single simple formula, but rather a procedural definition:
    1.  Arrange the $n$ observations in order: $x_{(1)} \le x_{(2)} \le \dots \le x_{(n)}$.
    2.  If $n$ is odd, the median is the middle value: $x_{((n+1)/2)}$.
    3.  If $n$ is even, the median is the average of the two middle values: $\frac{x_{(n/2)} + x_{((n/2)+1)}}{2}$.

*   **Example:**
    *   **Odd number of values:** `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`
        1.  Sorted: `[78, 85, 88, 90, 92]`
        2.  Number of scores ($n$) = 5 (odd)
        3.  Median is the $(5+1)/2 = 3^{rd}$ value, which is `88`.
    *   **Even number of values:** `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 70]`
        1.  Sorted: `[70, 78, 85, 88, 90, 92]`
        2.  Number of scores ($n$) = 6 (even)
        3.  Median is the average of the $6/2 = 3^{rd}$ value (`85`) and the $(6/2)+1 = 4^{th}$ value (`88`).
        4.  Median = $(85 + 88) / 2 = 86.5$

*   **Python Implementation:**

    ```python
    # Our datasets
    exam_scores_odd = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
    exam_scores_even = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 70]

    # --- Manual Calculation (for odd number of elements) ---
    sorted_scores_odd = sorted(exam_scores_odd)
    middle_index_odd = len(sorted_scores_odd) // 2 # Integer division
    median_manual_odd = sorted_scores_odd[middle_index_odd]
    print(f"Manual Median (odd): {median_manual_odd}")

    # --- Manual Calculation (for even number of elements) ---
    sorted_scores_even = sorted(exam_scores_even)
    n_even = len(sorted_scores_even)
    middle_index1_even = n_even // 2 - 1
    middle_index2_even = n_even // 2
    median_manual_even = (sorted_scores_even[middle_index1_even] + sorted_scores_even[middle_index2_even]) / 2
    print(f"Manual Median (even): {median_manual_even}")

    # --- Using NumPy ---
    median_numpy_odd = np.median(exam_scores_odd)
    print(f"NumPy Median (odd): {median_numpy_odd}")

    median_numpy_even = np.median(exam_scores_even)
    print(f"NumPy Median (even): {median_numpy_even}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Manual Median (odd): 88
    Manual Median (even): 86.5
    NumPy Median (odd): 88.0
    NumPy Median (even): 86.5
    ```

*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Pros:** Robust to outliers. If one score in `[78, 85, 88, 90, 92]` became `[0, 85, 88, 90, 92]`, the mean would change drastically, but the median would remain `88`. This makes it a better measure of central tendency for skewed distributions (e.g., income data).
    *   **Cons:** Does not use all data points in its calculation (only the middle one(s)), which can sometimes be seen as a loss of information.

##### **1.3. Mode**

*   **Explanation:** The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), multiple modes (multimodal), or no mode if all values appear with the same frequency.
*   **Intuition:** The mode tells us which value is the "most popular" or common.
*   **Mathematical Equation:**
    No specific formula, purely descriptive: the value $x_i$ for which its frequency $f(x_i)$ is highest.

*   **Example:**
    *   Dataset 1: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 90]`
        *   `90` appears twice, all others once. Mode = `90`.
    *   Dataset 2: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`
        *   All values appear once. No distinct mode.
    *   Dataset 3: `[85, 90, 78, 90, 85, 92]`
        *   `85` appears twice, `90` appears twice. Modes = `85` and `90` (bimodal).

*   **Python Implementation:**

    Python's standard library `collections.Counter` is great for counting frequencies, and `scipy.stats.mode` is specifically designed for this. Pandas also offers a `mode()` method.

    ```python
    from collections import Counter
    from scipy import stats
    import pandas as pd

    # Our datasets
    data1 = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 90]
    data2 = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]
    data3 = [85, 90, 78, 90, 85, 92]

    # --- Manual Calculation (using Counter) ---
    def get_mode_manual(data):
        counts = Counter(data)
        max_count = max(counts.values())
        modes = [key for key, value in counts.items() if value == max_count]
        if max_count == 1 and len(modes) == len(data): # All values appear once
            return "No distinct mode"
        return modes

    print(f"Manual Mode (data1): {get_mode_manual(data1)}")
    print(f"Manual Mode (data2): {get_mode_manual(data2)}")
    print(f"Manual Mode (data3): {get_mode_manual(data3)}")


    # --- Using SciPy ---
    # scipy.stats.mode returns a ModeResult object (mode value and count)
    # Note: If there are multiple modes, it returns only the first one found.
    # For multiple modes, it's better to use pandas or a custom function.
    mode_scipy1 = stats.mode(data1)
    print(f"SciPy Mode (data1): {mode_scipy1.mode[0]} (count: {mode_scipy1.count[0]})")


    # --- Using Pandas ---
    # Pandas Series.mode() can handle multiple modes
    series1 = pd.Series(data1)
    series2 = pd.Series(data2)
    series3 = pd.Series(data3)

    print(f"Pandas Mode (data1): {series1.mode().tolist()}")
    print(f"Pandas Mode (data2): {series2.mode().tolist()}") # Returns all values if no unique mode
    print(f"Pandas Mode (data3): {series3.mode().tolist()}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Manual Mode (data1): [90]
    Manual Mode (data2): No distinct mode
    Manual Mode (data3): [85, 90]
    SciPy Mode (data1): 90 (count: 2)
    Pandas Mode (data1): [90]
    Pandas Mode (data2): [78, 85, 88, 90, 92]
    Pandas Mode (data3): [85, 90]
    ```

*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Pros:** Useful for both numerical and categorical data. Not affected by outliers.
    *   **Cons:** Not always unique. May not exist for continuous data where no values repeat exactly. Can be ambiguous with multiple modes.

---

#### **2. Measures of Dispersion (Variability)**

These statistics tell us how spread out or varied the data points are from the center.

##### **2.1. Variance**

*   **Explanation:** Variance measures the average squared difference of each data point from the mean. A high variance indicates that data points are spread far from the mean and from each other, while a low variance indicates that data points are clustered closely around the mean.
*   **Intuition:** Think of it as quantifying "how much the data typically deviates" from the mean, but by squaring the differences, it gives more weight to larger deviations and avoids negative values cancelling out positive ones.
*   **Mathematical Equation:**
    There are two common forms: population variance ($\sigma^2$) and sample variance ($s^2$). In Data Science, we almost always work with samples, so sample variance is more common.

    **Population Variance ($\sigma^2$):**
    $$ \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N} $$
    Where:
    *   $\sigma^2$ (sigma squared) is the population variance.
    *   $x_i$ is the $i$-th observation.
    *   $\mu$ (mu) is the population mean.
    *   $N$ is the total number of observations in the population.

    **Sample Variance ($s^2$):**
    $$ s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} $$
    Where:
    *   $s^2$ is the sample variance.
    *   $x_i$ is the $i$-th observation.
    *   $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.
    *   $n$ is the total number of observations in the sample.

    **Why $n-1$ for sample variance? (Bessel's Correction)**
    When you calculate the variance from a *sample* instead of the entire *population*, the sample mean ($\bar{x}$) is used as an estimate for the population mean ($\mu$). The values in a sample tend to be closer to their *own* sample mean than to the *true population mean*. This causes the sum of squared differences $(x_i - \bar{x})^2$ to be slightly *smaller* than it would be if we used the true population mean. Dividing by $n-1$ instead of $n$ corrects this downward bias, providing a better, unbiased estimate of the population variance. For large datasets, the difference between dividing by $n$ and $n-1$ becomes negligible.

*   **Example:** Consider the exam scores: `[85, 90, 78, 92, 88]`.
    *   We already found the mean ($\bar{x}$) = `86.6`.
    *   Calculate the squared differences from the mean:
        *   $(85 - 86.6)^2 = (-1.6)^2 = 2.56$
        *   $(90 - 86.6)^2 = (3.4)^2 = 11.56$
        *   $(78 - 86.6)^2 = (-8.6)^2 = 73.96$
        *   $(92 - 86.6)^2 = (5.4)^2 = 29.16$
        *   $(88 - 86.6)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96$
    *   Sum of squared differences = $2.56 + 11.56 + 73.96 + 29.16 + 1.96 = 119.2$
    *   Number of observations ($n$) = $5$
    *   Sample Variance ($s^2$) = $119.2 / (5-1) = 119.2 / 4 = 29.8$

*   **Python Implementation:**

    ```python
    exam_scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]

    # --- Manual Calculation (Sample Variance) ---
    mean_scores = sum(exam_scores) / len(exam_scores)
    squared_diffs = [(x - mean_scores)**2 for x in exam_scores]
    sum_squared_diffs = sum(squared_diffs)
    sample_variance_manual = sum_squared_diffs / (len(exam_scores) - 1)
    print(f"Manual Sample Variance: {sample_variance_manual}")

    # --- Using NumPy ---
    # By default, numpy.var calculates population variance (ddof=0).
    # To get sample variance, set ddof=1 (delta degrees of freedom).
    sample_variance_numpy = np.var(exam_scores, ddof=1)
    print(f"NumPy Sample Variance: {sample_variance_numpy}")

    # Population variance for comparison
    population_variance_numpy = np.var(exam_scores, ddof=0)
    print(f"NumPy Population Variance: {population_variance_numpy}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Manual Sample Variance: 29.8
    NumPy Sample Variance: 29.8
    NumPy Population Variance: 23.84
    ```

*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Pros:** Quantifies the spread of data around the mean, essential for many statistical tests and models.
    *   **Cons:** The units of variance are the squared units of the original data (e.g., if scores are in points, variance is in points squared). This makes it less intuitive to interpret directly. This is where standard deviation comes in.

##### **2.2. Standard Deviation**

*   **Explanation:** The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance. It measures the typical amount of variation or dispersion of a dataset from its mean.
*   **Intuition:** Because it's in the same units as the original data, it's much easier to interpret than variance. A small standard deviation means data points are generally close to the mean, while a large standard deviation means they are widely dispersed.
*   **Mathematical Equation:**
    **Population Standard Deviation ($\sigma$):**
    $$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}} = \sqrt{\sigma^2} $$
    **Sample Standard Deviation ($s$):**
    $$ s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}} = \sqrt{s^2} $$

*   **Example:** Using the previous exam scores and sample variance:
    *   Sample Variance ($s^2$) = `29.8`
    *   Sample Standard Deviation ($s$) = $\sqrt{29.8} \approx 5.459$

    This means that, on average, the exam scores deviate by approximately 5.46 points from the mean of 86.6.

*   **Python Implementation:**

    ```python
    exam_scores = [85, 90, 78, 92, 88]

    # We already calculated sample_variance_manual = 29.8

    # --- Manual Calculation (Sample Standard Deviation) ---
    import math
    sample_std_dev_manual = math.sqrt(sample_variance_manual)
    print(f"Manual Sample Standard Deviation: {sample_std_dev_manual}")

    # --- Using NumPy ---
    # Similarly, numpy.std defaults to population standard deviation (ddof=0).
    # For sample standard deviation, set ddof=1.
    sample_std_dev_numpy = np.std(exam_scores, ddof=1)
    print(f"NumPy Sample Standard Deviation: {sample_std_dev_numpy}")

    # Population standard deviation for comparison
    population_std_dev_numpy = np.std(exam_scores, ddof=0)
    print(f"NumPy Population Standard Deviation: {population_std_dev_numpy}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Manual Sample Standard Deviation: 5.458937667926197
    NumPy Sample Standard Deviation: 5.458937667926197
    NumPy Population Standard Deviation: 4.882622248590393
    ```

*   **Discussion:**
    *   **Pros:** Directly interpretable as it's in the same units as the original data. Widely used as a measure of risk (e.g., in finance). Forms the basis for understanding normal distributions (e.g., 68-95-99.7 rule, which we'll cover later).
    *   **Cons:** Like the mean and variance, it's sensitive to outliers.

### **Summarized Notes for Revision: Descriptive Statistics (Part 1)**

**1. Measures of Central Tendency (Where is the data centered?)**

*   **Mean ($\bar{x}$):**
    *   **Definition:** Average of all values. Sum of values / number of values.
    *   **Formula:** $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n}$
    *   **Use Case:** Good for symmetrically distributed data without extreme outliers.
    *   **Sensitivity:** Highly sensitive to outliers.
*   **Median:**
    *   **Definition:** The middle value when data is ordered. If even count, average of the two middle values.
    *   **Use Case:** Best for skewed data or data with outliers (e.g., income, house prices).
    *   **Sensitivity:** Robust to outliers.
*   **Mode:**
    *   **Definition:** The most frequently occurring value(s).
    *   **Use Case:** Useful for both numerical and categorical data. Indicates most popular category/value.
    *   **Sensitivity:** Not affected by outliers. Can have multiple modes or no mode.

**2. Measures of Dispersion (How spread out is the data?)**

*   **Variance ($s^2$ or $\sigma^2$):**
    *   **Definition:** Average of the squared differences from the mean.
    *   **Formula (Sample):** $s^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}$ (uses $n-1$ for unbiased estimate of population variance)
    *   **Intuition:** Quantifies how much the data typically deviates from the mean (squared units).
    *   **Units:** Squared units of the original data, making direct interpretation difficult.
*   **Standard Deviation ($s$ or $\sigma$):**
    *   **Definition:** The square root of the variance.
    *   **Formula (Sample):** $s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$
    *   **Intuition:** Represents the typical amount of variation or spread of data points from the mean, in the original units of the data.
    *   **Units:** Same units as the original data, making it highly interpretable.
    *   **Sensitivity:** Sensitive to outliers.

#### **Sub-topic 1.2: Statistics & Probability (Part 2: Inferential Statistics)**

**Overview:**
Inferential statistics allows us to make inferences, or educated guesses, about a population based on a sample. The core idea is to use probability to determine how confident we can be in our conclusions. A key technique in inferential statistics is **Hypothesis Testing**, which provides a structured way to evaluate claims or theories about populations.

---

#### **1. Population vs. Sample**

Before diving into hypothesis testing, it's crucial to understand these fundamental concepts:

*   **Population:** The entire group of individuals or items that we are interested in studying. It's often too large or impossible to measure entirely.
    *   **Examples:** All potential customers for a new product, all cars ever manufactured, all students in a country.
    *   **Parameters:** Numerical summaries that describe a characteristic of the *population* (e.g., population mean $\mu$, population standard deviation $\sigma$). These are usually unknown.

*   **Sample:** A subset of the population that we actually collect data from. We use the sample to make inferences about the population.
    *   **Examples:** 100 random potential customers, 50 randomly selected cars, 200 random students.
    *   **Statistics:** Numerical summaries that describe a characteristic of the *sample* (e.g., sample mean $\bar{x}$, sample standard deviation $s$). These are known because we calculate them from our collected data.

**Intuition:** Imagine you want to know the average height of all adults in your country (population parameter $\mu$). You can't measure everyone. So, you measure a representative group of 1000 adults (sample). The average height of these 1000 adults is your sample statistic $\bar{x}$. Inferential statistics helps you use $\bar{x}$ to say something meaningful about $\mu$.

---

#### **2. The Concept of Hypothesis Testing**

Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure to investigate our ideas about the world using statistical evidence. It's essentially a method for deciding whether to accept or reject a claim about a population parameter.

**The Analogy of a Court Trial:**
Think of a court trial:
*   The defendant is assumed innocent until proven guilty. This is like the **Null Hypothesis**.
*   The prosecutor tries to gather enough evidence to prove guilt. This is like collecting **data**.
*   If there's enough convincing evidence *against* the assumption of innocence (beyond a reasonable doubt), the defendant is found guilty. This is like **rejecting the Null Hypothesis**.
*   If there isn't enough evidence to prove guilt, the defendant is found not guilty. This is like **failing to reject the Null Hypothesis**. (Note: "Not guilty" is not the same as "innocent," just like "failing to reject $H_0$" is not the same as "proving $H_0$ is true.")

##### **2.1. Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**

*   **Explanation:** The null hypothesis is a statement of "no effect," "no difference," or "no relationship." It represents the status quo or a commonly accepted belief. It's the hypothesis we assume to be true until proven otherwise.
*   **Mathematical Notation:** Always contains an equality sign ($=$, $\le$, or $\ge$).
    *   **Example:** $H_0: \mu = 100$ (The population mean is 100).
    *   **Example:** $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ (There is no difference between the means of two populations).

##### **2.2. Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$)**

*   **Explanation:** The alternative hypothesis is what we are trying to prove. It contradicts the null hypothesis and suggests that there *is* an effect, a difference, or a relationship.
*   **Mathematical Notation:** Always contains an inequality sign ($ \ne $, $<$, or $>$).
    *   **Example:** $H_1: \mu \ne 100$ (The population mean is not 100 - **Two-tailed test**).
    *   **Example:** $H_1: \mu > 100$ (The population mean is greater than 100 - **One-tailed test, right-tailed**).
    *   **Example:** $H_1: \mu < 100$ (The population mean is less than 100 - **One-tailed test, left-tailed**).

##### **2.3. Significance Level ($\alpha$)**

*   **Explanation:** The significance level (alpha) is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It's the threshold for how much evidence we require to reject $H_0$. Commonly set to 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%), or 0.10 (10%).
*   **Intuition:** It's the maximum acceptable risk of making a **Type I error** (false positive).
*   **Setting $\alpha$:** It should be chosen *before* conducting the test. A smaller $\alpha$ means we need stronger evidence to reject $H_0$.

##### **2.4. Test Statistic**

*   **Explanation:** A value calculated from your sample data during a hypothesis test. Its purpose is to measure how far your sample statistic (e.g., sample mean) deviates from what you'd expect if the null hypothesis were true, relative to the variability in the data.
*   **Intuition:** It quantifies the "evidence" against the null hypothesis. The larger the absolute value of the test statistic, the more evidence there is against $H_0$.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Z-statistic:** Used when the population standard deviation is known or the sample size is very large ($n \ge 30$) and the data is normally distributed.
    *   **T-statistic:** Used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small ($n < 30$), but the data is approximately normally distributed.
    *   **Chi-square statistic, F-statistic:** Used for other types of hypothesis tests.

##### **2.5. P-value**

*   **Explanation:** The p-value (probability value) is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one calculated from your sample data, *assuming that the null hypothesis ($H_0$) is true*.
*   **Intuition:** It quantifies the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value means that observing your data (or more extreme data) would be very unlikely if $H_0$ were true, thus providing strong evidence against $H_0$. A large p-value means your observed data is quite plausible under $H_0$.
*   **Crucial Note:** The p-value is **NOT** the probability that the null hypothesis is true, nor is it the probability that the alternative hypothesis is false. It's a conditional probability: $P(\text{Data or more extreme} \mid H_0 \text{ is true})$.

##### **2.6. Decision Rule**

After calculating the test statistic and its corresponding p-value, we compare the p-value to our pre-defined significance level ($\alpha$).

*   **If P-value $\le \alpha$:** **Reject the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**. This means there is statistically significant evidence to support the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$).
*   **If P-value $> \alpha$:** **Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**. This means there is not enough statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We don't "accept" $H_0$, we just don't have enough evidence to confidently say it's false.

##### **2.7. Type I and Type II Errors**

When conducting a hypothesis test, there's always a risk of making a wrong decision:

*   **Type I Error ($\alpha$):** Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.
    *   **Analogy:** Falsely convicting an innocent person.
    *   **Probability of Type I Error:** $\alpha$ (the significance level).
    *   **Consequences:** Can be serious (e.g., launching a new drug that is ineffective).

*   **Type II Error ($\beta$):** Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.
    *   **Analogy:** Letting a guilty person go free.
    *   **Probability of Type II Error:** $\beta$.
    *   **Power of the Test (1 - $\beta$):** The probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
    *   **Consequences:** Can also be serious (e.g., failing to identify an effective new drug).

There's a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors: decreasing $\alpha$ (making it harder to reject $H_0$) increases $\beta$ (making it harder to detect a true effect).

---

#### **3. Common Hypothesis Tests (Examples)**

While there are many types of hypothesis tests, the `t-test` is a very common one for comparing means.

##### **3.1. One-Sample T-test**

*   **Purpose:** To compare the mean of a single sample to a known (or hypothesized) population mean.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   The sample data is continuous.
    *   The sample is randomly drawn from the population.
    *   The population from which the sample is drawn is approximately normally distributed (or sample size is large, $n \ge 30$, due to Central Limit Theorem).
    *   The population standard deviation is unknown.

*   **Hypotheses Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** A company claims their light bulbs last 1000 hours on average. You test a sample of bulbs to see if this claim holds.
    *   $H_0: \mu = 1000$ (The true average lifespan is 1000 hours).
    *   $H_1: \mu \ne 1000$ (The true average lifespan is not 1000 hours - two-tailed).

*   **Mathematical Intuition (T-statistic):**
    $$ t = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}} $$
    Where:
    *   $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.
    *   $\mu_0$ is the hypothesized population mean (from $H_0$).
    *   $s$ is the sample standard deviation.
    *   $n$ is the sample size.
    *   The denominator $s / \sqrt{n}$ is the **standard error of the mean**, which estimates the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean.

    The t-statistic measures how many standard errors the sample mean is away from the hypothesized population mean.

*   **Python Implementation (One-Sample T-test):**

    Let's use an example: A cereal company claims that each box contains 368 grams of cereal. We collect a sample of 10 boxes and weigh them. Do our findings support the company's claim? We'll use $\alpha = 0.05$.

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from scipy import stats

    # Sample data: weights of 10 cereal boxes (in grams)
    cereal_weights = [360, 362, 365, 368, 370, 361, 363, 366, 369, 364]
    hypothesized_mean = 368 # The company's claim

    # Perform the one-sample t-test
    # stats.ttest_1samp returns (test_statistic, p_value)
    t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(cereal_weights, hypothesized_mean)

    print(f"Sample Mean: {np.mean(cereal_weights):.2f}")
    print(f"Test Statistic (t-value): {t_statistic:.3f}")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value:.3f}")

    # Set significance level
    alpha = 0.05

    # Make a decision
    if p_value <= alpha:
        print(f"Since p-value ({p_value:.3f}) <= alpha ({alpha}), we reject the Null Hypothesis.")
        print("Conclusion: There is significant evidence to suggest the true average cereal weight is NOT 368 grams.")
    else:
        print(f"Since p-value ({p_value:.3f}) > alpha ({alpha}), we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis.")
        print("Conclusion: There is NOT enough significant evidence to suggest the true average cereal weight is different from 368 grams.")

    # Let's try a different sample where the mean is far off
    cereal_weights_low = [350, 352, 355, 358, 360, 351, 353, 356, 359, 354]
    t_statistic_low, p_value_low = stats.ttest_1samp(cereal_weights_low, hypothesized_mean)

    print("\n--- Testing with a significantly lower sample mean ---")
    print(f"Sample Mean: {np.mean(cereal_weights_low):.2f}")
    print(f"Test Statistic (t-value): {t_statistic_low:.3f}")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value_low:.3f}")

    if p_value_low <= alpha:
        print(f"Since p-value ({p_value_low:.3f}) <= alpha ({alpha}), we reject the Null Hypothesis.")
        print("Conclusion: There is significant evidence to suggest the true average cereal weight is NOT 368 grams.")
    else:
        print(f"Since p-value ({p_value_low:.3f}) > alpha ({alpha}), we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis.")
        print("Conclusion: There is NOT enough significant evidence to suggest the true average cereal weight is different from 368 grams.")
    ```

    **Output:**
    ```
    Sample Mean: 364.80
    Test Statistic (t-value): -3.000
    P-value: 0.015
    Since p-value (0.015) <= alpha (0.05), we reject the Null Hypothesis.
    Conclusion: There is significant evidence to suggest the true average cereal weight is NOT 368 grams.

    --- Testing with a significantly lower sample mean ---
    Sample Mean: 354.80
    Test Statistic (t-value): -11.583
    P-value: 0.000
    Since p-value (0.000) <= alpha (0.05), we reject the Null Hypothesis.
    Conclusion: There is significant evidence to suggest the true average cereal weight is NOT 368 grams.
    ```
    **Interpretation:**
    *   In the first case, our p-value (0.015) is less than our alpha (0.05). This means that if the true mean *were* 368g, it would be very unlikely to observe a sample mean of 364.8g (or more extreme) by chance. Therefore, we reject the company's claim.
    *   In the second case, with a much lower sample mean, the p-value is extremely small (0.000), providing even stronger evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

##### **3.2. Two-Sample Independent T-test**

*   **Purpose:** To compare the means of two independent samples to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Both samples are continuous data.
    *   Samples are independent.
    *   Both populations are approximately normally distributed (or sample sizes are large).
    *   Population standard deviations are unknown.
    *   (Optional assumption for some versions of the test: Equal variances between the two populations. `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` has a `equal_var` parameter for this.)

*   **Hypotheses Example:**
    *   **Scenario:** A marketing team wants to know if a new advertisement campaign ("Campaign B") results in significantly higher customer engagement than the old campaign ("Campaign A").
    *   $H_0: \mu_A = \mu_B$ (There is no difference in average engagement between the two campaigns).
    *   $H_1: \mu_A \ne \mu_B$ (There is a difference in average engagement - two-tailed).
        *   Alternatively, if they specifically expect Campaign B to be *higher*: $H_1: \mu_A < \mu_B$ (or $\mu_B > \mu_A$ - one-tailed).

*   **Mathematical Intuition (T-statistic):**
    $$ t = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{s_p \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2}}} $$
    Where:
    *   $\bar{x}_1, \bar{x}_2$ are the sample means.
    *   $\mu_1 - \mu_2$ is the hypothesized difference in population means (usually 0 under $H_0$).
    *   $s_p$ is the pooled standard deviation (an estimate of the common standard deviation when assuming equal variances).
    *   $n_1, n_2$ are the sample sizes.

    The t-statistic measures how many standard errors the difference between the two sample means is away from the hypothesized difference in population means (often zero).

*   **Python Implementation (Two-Sample T-test):**

    Let's compare the effectiveness of two different fertilizers on crop yield (in bushels per acre). We'll assume $\alpha = 0.05$.

    ```python
    import numpy as np
    from scipy import stats

    # Sample data: crop yields for two fertilizers
    fertilizer_A_yields = [55, 58, 60, 57, 61, 56, 59, 62, 58, 60] # n=10
    fertilizer_B_yields = [60, 63, 65, 62, 66, 61, 64, 67, 63, 65] # n=10

    # Perform the two-sample independent t-test
    # We'll use equal_var=True as a common assumption, but in real world,
    # you'd check variance equality (e.g., Levene's test)
    t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(fertilizer_A_yields, fertilizer_B_yields, equal_var=True)

    print(f"Mean Yield (Fertilizer A): {np.mean(fertilizer_A_yields):.2f}")
    print(f"Mean Yield (Fertilizer B): {np.mean(fertilizer_B_yields):.2f}")
    print(f"Test Statistic (t-value): {t_statistic:.3f}")
    print(f"P-value: {p_value:.3f}")

    # Set significance level
    alpha = 0.05

    # Make a decision
    if p_value <= alpha:
        print(f"Since p-value ({p_value:.3f}) <= alpha ({alpha}), we reject the Null Hypothesis.")
        print("Conclusion: There is significant evidence to suggest a difference in average crop yields between Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B.")
        if np.mean(fertilizer_A_yields) < np.mean(fertilizer_B_yields):
            print("Specifically, Fertilizer B appears to result in higher yields.")
        else:
            print("Specifically, Fertilizer A appears to result in higher yields.")
    else:
        print(f"Since p-value ({p_value:.3f}) > alpha ({alpha}), we fail to reject the Null Hypothesis.")
        print("Conclusion: There is NOT enough significant evidence to suggest a difference in average crop yields between Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B.")
    ```

    **Output:**
    ```
    Mean Yield (Fertilizer A): 58.60
    Mean Yield (Fertilizer B): 63.60
    Test Statistic (t-value): -5.871
    P-value: 0.000
    Since p-value (0.000) <= alpha (0.05), we reject the Null Hypothesis.
    Conclusion: There is significant evidence to suggest a difference in average crop yields between Fertilizer A and Fertilizer B.
    Specifically, Fertilizer B appears to result in higher yields.
    ```
    **Interpretation:**
    *   The p-value (0.000) is much less than our alpha (0.05). This indicates that if there were truly no difference between the fertilizers, observing such a large difference in sample means (58.6 vs 63.6) would be extremely unlikely.
    *   Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that Fertilizer B significantly improves crop yield compared to Fertilizer A.

### **Summarized Notes for Revision: Inferential Statistics (Part 1)**

**1. Fundamentals**
*   **Population:** The entire group of interest. Described by **Parameters** (e.g., $\mu, \sigma$).
*   **Sample:** A subset of the population used for study. Described by **Statistics** (e.g., $\bar{x}, s$).
*   **Inferential Statistics:** Uses sample statistics to make inferences about population parameters.

**2. Hypothesis Testing Framework**
*   **Purpose:** A formal procedure to evaluate a claim about a population using sample data.
*   **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):**
    *   Statement of "no effect," "no difference," or "status quo."
    *   Always contains an equality ($=, \le, \ge$).
    *   Assumed true until enough evidence suggests otherwise.
*   **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$):**
    *   Contradicts $H_0$; what we're trying to prove.
    *   Always contains an inequality ($\ne, <, >$).
*   **Significance Level ($\alpha$):**
    *   The threshold for statistical significance (e.g., 0.05, 0.01).
    *   Represents the maximum acceptable probability of a **Type I Error**.
*   **Test Statistic:**
    *   A value calculated from sample data that measures how much the sample evidence deviates from $H_0$.
    *   Examples: t-statistic, z-statistic.
*   **P-value:**
    *   **Definition:** The probability of observing data as extreme as (or more extreme than) your sample data, *assuming $H_0$ is true*.
    *   **Interpretation:** A small p-value means the observed data is unlikely under $H_0$, providing strong evidence against $H_0$.
*   **Decision Rule:**
    *   **If P-value $\le \alpha$:** **Reject $H_0$**. Conclude there is significant evidence for $H_1$.
    *   **If P-value $> \alpha$:** **Fail to Reject $H_0$**. Conclude there is insufficient evidence to reject $H_0$.
*   **Errors:**
    *   **Type I Error ($\alpha$):** Rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true (False Positive).
    *   **Type II Error ($\beta$):** Failing to reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is false (False Negative).

**3. Common Tests (T-tests)**
*   **One-Sample T-test:**
    *   **Use Case:** Compares a sample mean to a hypothesized population mean.
    *   **Example:** Is the average weight of cereal boxes 368g?
*   **Two-Sample Independent T-test:**
    *   **Use Case:** Compares the means of two independent samples.
    *   **Example:** Is there a difference in crop yield between two fertilizers?
*   **Python Tool:** `scipy.stats` library (e.g., `stats.ttest_1samp`, `stats.ttest_ind`).

#### **Sub-topic 1.3: Statistics & Probability (Part 3: Probability Distributions & Bayes\' Theorem)**

**Overview:**
A **probability distribution** is a function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. Understanding these distributions allows us to model real-world phenomena, make predictions, and quantify uncertainty. We\'ll cover three fundamental distributions: Binomial, Poisson (both discrete), and Normal (continuous). We will then explore **Bayes\' Theorem**, a powerful concept for updating our beliefs about an event based on new evidence.

---

#### **1. Probability Distributions**

A **random variable** is a variable whose value is subject to variations due to chance. There are two main types:

*   **Discrete Random Variable:** Can take on a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values (e.g., number of heads in coin flips, number of cars passing a point in an hour). Its distribution is described by a **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**.
*   **Continuous Random Variable:** Can take on any value within a given range (e.g., height, temperature, time). Its distribution is described by a **Probability Density Function (PDF)**. For a continuous variable, the probability of any single exact value is zero; we talk about probabilities over intervals.

Both PMFs and PDFs are used to calculate the **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**, which gives the probability that a random variable takes a value less than or equal to a certain value.

##### **1.1. Binomial Distribution**

*   **Explanation:** The binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (experiments with only two possible outcomes: success or failure), where the probability of success remains constant for each trial.
*   **Intuition:** Think of repeating an action a certain number of times and counting how many times a specific outcome occurs.
    *   **Example 1:** Flipping a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads.
    *   **Example 2:** Testing 20 products from a production line and counting how many are defective.
*   **Key Parameters:**
    *   $n$: The number of trials.
    *   $p$: The probability of success on a single trial.
*   **Mathematical Equation (Probability Mass Function - PMF):**
    The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by:
    $$ P(X=k) = C(n, k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k} $$
    Where:
    *   $C(n, k)$ (read as "n choose k") is the binomial coefficient, calculated as $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. It represents the number of ways to choose $k$ successes from $n$ trials.
    *   $p^k$ is the probability of getting $k$ successes.
    *   $(1-p)^{n-k}$ is the probability of getting $n-k$ failures.
*   **Example:** A biased coin lands on heads with a probability of 0.6. If you flip the coin 5 times, what is the probability of getting exactly 3 heads?
    *   $n = 5$ (number of flips)
    *   $k = 3$ (number of heads)
    *   $p = 0.6$ (probability of heads)
    *   $P(X=3) = C(5, 3) \cdot (0.6)^3 \cdot (1-0.6)^{5-3}$
    *   $C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{120}{6 \cdot 2} = 10$
    *   $P(X=3) = 10 \cdot (0.6)^3 \cdot (0.4)^2 = 10 \cdot 0.216 \cdot 0.16 = 0.3456$
    So, there\'s a 34.56% chance of getting exactly 3 heads.

*   **Python Implementation:**
    We use `scipy.stats.binom` for binomial distribution functions. `pmf` calculates the probability of exactly $k$ successes, and `cdf` calculates the cumulative probability (probability of $k$ or fewer successes).

    ```python
    from scipy.stats import binom
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    n = 5    # Number of trials (coin flips)
    p = 0.6  # Probability of success (getting heads)

    # Probability of exactly 3 heads
    k_successes = 3
    prob_3_heads = binom.pmf(k_successes, n, p)
    print(f"Probability of exactly {k_successes} heads: {prob_3_heads:.4f}")

    # Probability of 2 or fewer heads (CDF)
    prob_le_2_heads = binom.cdf(2, n, p)
    print(f"Probability of 2 or fewer heads: {prob_le_2_heads:.4f}")

    # Probability of more than 3 heads (1 - CDF of 3 or fewer)
    prob_gt_3_heads = 1 - binom.cdf(3, n, p)
    print(f"Probability of more than 3 heads: {prob_gt_3_heads:.4f}")


    # --- Visualization of Binomial Distribution ---
    k_values = np.arange(0, n + 1) # Possible number of successes (0 to 5)
    pmf_values = binom.pmf(k_values, n, p)

    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
    plt.bar(k_values, pmf_values, color='skyblue')
    plt.title(f'Binomial Distribution (n={n}, p={p})')
    plt.xlabel('Number of Successes (k)')
    plt.ylabel('Probability P(X=k)')
    plt.xticks(k_values)
    plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
    plt.show()
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Probability of exactly 3 heads: 0.3456
    Probability of 2 or fewer heads: 0.3174
    Probability of more than 3 heads: 0.3370
    ```
    **(A bar plot showing the probabilities for each number of successes from 0 to 5 would be displayed)**

##### **1.2. Poisson Distribution**

*   **Explanation:** The Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given the average rate of occurrence and that these events happen independently at a constant average rate.
*   **Intuition:** It\'s used for counting rare events over a continuous interval.
    *   **Example 1:** Number of calls received by a call center in an hour.
    *   **Example 2:** Number of defects on a roll of fabric.
    *   **Example 3:** Number of cars passing a certain point on a road in 10 minutes.
*   **Key Parameter:**
    *   $\lambda$ (lambda): The average number of events in the specified interval.
*   **Mathematical Equation (Probability Mass Function - PMF):**
    The probability of observing exactly $k$ events in an interval is given by:
    $$ P(X=k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!} $$
    Where:
    *   $e$ is Euler\'s number (approximately 2.71828).
    *   $\lambda$ is the average number of events per interval.
    *   $k$ is the actual number of events observed ($k=0, 1, 2, \dots$).
    *   $k!$ is the factorial of $k$.
*   **Example:** A call center receives an average of 4 calls per hour. What is the probability of receiving exactly 2 calls in the next hour?
    *   $\lambda = 4$ (average calls per hour)
    *   $k = 2$ (number of calls observed)
    *   $P(X=2) = \frac{e^{-4} \cdot 4^2}{2!} = \frac{0.0183 \cdot 16}{2} = 0.1464$
    So, there\'s about a 14.64% chance of receiving exactly 2 calls.

*   **Python Implementation:**
    We use `scipy.stats.poisson`. `pmf` calculates the probability of exactly $k$ events, and `cdf` calculates the cumulative probability.

    ```python
    from scipy.stats import poisson
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    lambda_param = 4 # Average number of calls per hour

    # Probability of exactly 2 calls
    k_events = 2
    prob_2_calls = poisson.pmf(k_events, lambda_param)
    print(f"Probability of exactly {k_events} calls: {prob_2_calls:.4f}")

    # Probability of 3 or fewer calls (CDF)
    prob_le_3_calls = poisson.cdf(3, lambda_param)
    print(f"Probability of 3 or fewer calls: {prob_le_3_calls:.4f}")

    # Probability of more than 5 calls (1 - CDF of 5 or fewer)
    prob_gt_5_calls = 1 - poisson.cdf(5, lambda_param)
    print(f"Probability of more than 5 calls: {prob_gt_5_calls:.4f}")

    # --- Visualization of Poisson Distribution ---
    k_values_poisson = np.arange(0, 10) # A reasonable range for number of events
    pmf_values_poisson = poisson.pmf(k_values_poisson, lambda_param)

    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
    plt.bar(k_values_poisson, pmf_values_poisson, color='lightcoral')
    plt.title(f'Poisson Distribution (λ={lambda_param})')
    plt.xlabel('Number of Events (k)')
    plt.ylabel('Probability P(X=k)')
    plt.xticks(k_values_poisson)
    plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
    plt.show()
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Probability of exactly 2 calls: 0.1465
    Probability of 3 or fewer calls: 0.4335
    Probability of more than 5 calls: 0.2149
    ```
    **(A bar plot showing the probabilities for each number of events from 0 to 9 would be displayed)**

##### **1.3. Normal (Gaussian) Distribution**

*   **Explanation:** The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or "bell curve," is the most common and arguably most important continuous probability distribution. Many natural phenomena (heights, blood pressure, measurement errors) tend to follow this distribution due to the **Central Limit Theorem** (which we will discuss later).
*   **Intuition:** It describes data that clusters around a central mean, with values tapering off symmetrically as they move further away from the mean.
*   **Key Parameters:**
    *   $\mu$ (mu): The mean of the distribution (where the peak of the bell curve is located).
    *   $\sigma$ (sigma): The standard deviation of the distribution (controls the spread of the curve; larger $\sigma$ means wider, flatter curve).
*   **Properties:**
    *   Symmetric about its mean ($\mu$).
    *   Mean, median, and mode are all equal.
    *   The total area under the curve is 1.
    *   **Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule):** For a normal distribution:
        *   Approximately 68% of the data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean ($\mu \pm 1\sigma$).
        *   Approximately 95% of the data falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean ($\mu \pm 2\sigma$).
        *   Approximately 99.7% of the data falls within 3 standard deviations of the mean ($\mu \pm 3\sigma$).
*   **Mathematical Equation (Probability Density Function - PDF):**
    $$ f(x | \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$
    Where:
    *   $x$ is the value of the random variable.
    *   $\mu$ is the mean.
    *   $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.
    *   $\pi$ (pi) is approximately 3.14159.
*   **Example:** Suppose adult male heights in a country are normally distributed with a mean of 175 cm and a standard deviation of 7 cm.
    *   68% of men are between $175 - 7 = 168$ cm and $175 + 7 = 182$ cm.
    *   95% of men are between $175 - 2\cdot7 = 161$ cm and $175 + 2\cdot7 = 189$ cm.
    *   What is the probability that a randomly selected man is taller than 185 cm? (We\'ll calculate this with Python.)

*   **Python Implementation:**
    We use `scipy.stats.norm`. `pdf` gives the probability density at a specific point (not a probability for continuous variables), `cdf` gives the cumulative probability (area to the left), and `ppf` (percent point function) gives the value associated with a given probability (inverse of CDF).

    ```python
    from scipy.stats import norm
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    mean_height = 175 # cm
    std_dev_height = 7 # cm

    # --- Probability Density Function (PDF) ---
    # This value isn't a probability, but the height of the curve at a point.
    # For continuous distributions, P(X=x) is 0.
    pdf_at_175 = norm.pdf(175, mean_height, std_dev_height)
    print(f"PDF at height 175 cm (peak): {pdf_at_175:.4f}")

    # --- Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) ---
    # Probability of a man being shorter than 170 cm
    prob_less_170 = norm.cdf(170, mean_height, std_dev_height)
    print(f"Probability a man is shorter than 170 cm: {prob_less_170:.4f}")

    # Probability of a man being taller than 185 cm (1 - CDF)
    prob_taller_185 = 1 - norm.cdf(185, mean_height, std_dev_height)
    print(f"Probability a man is taller than 185 cm: {prob_taller_185:.4f}")

    # Probability of a man being between 165 cm and 180 cm
    prob_between_165_180 = norm.cdf(180, mean_height, std_dev_height) - norm.cdf(165, mean_height, std_dev_height)
    print(f"Probability a man is between 165 cm and 180 cm: {prob_between_165_180:.4f}")

    # --- Percent Point Function (PPF) - Inverse of CDF ---
    # What height corresponds to the 95th percentile (i.e., 95% of men are shorter than this)?
    height_95th_percentile = norm.ppf(0.95, mean_height, std_dev_height)
    print(f"Height at 95th percentile: {height_95th_percentile:.2f} cm")

    # --- Visualization of Normal Distribution ---
    x_values = np.linspace(mean_height - 4*std_dev_height, mean_height + 4*std_dev_height, 1000)
    pdf_values_normal = norm.pdf(x_values, mean_height, std_dev_height)

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(x_values, pdf_values_normal, color='darkblue', linewidth=2)
    plt.title(f'Normal Distribution (μ={mean_height} cm, σ={std_dev_height} cm)')
    plt.xlabel('Height (cm)')
    plt.ylabel('Probability Density')
    plt.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.6)

    # Mark mean and +/- 1, 2, 3 standard deviations
    plt.axvline(mean_height, color='red', linestyle=':', label='Mean')
    plt.axvspan(mean_height - std_dev_height, mean_height + std_dev_height, color='green', alpha=0.1, label='±1 Std Dev (68%)')
    plt.axvspan(mean_height - 2*std_dev_height, mean_height + 2*std_dev_height, color='orange', alpha=0.07, label='±2 Std Dev (95%)')

    plt.show()
    ```
    **Output:**

#### **2. Bayes\' Theorem**

##### **2.1. Introduction to Conditional Probability**

Before Bayes\' Theorem, let\'s quickly review **conditional probability**: the probability of an event A occurring, *given that another event B has already occurred*. It\'s written as $P(A|B)$.

*   **Formula:** $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
    Where:
    *   $P(A \cap B)$ is the probability that both A and B occur (their intersection).
    *   $P(B)$ is the probability that event B occurs.
*   **Example:** What\'s the probability that a student passed an exam ($A$), given that they studied for it ($B$)? You\'d need to know the probability of a student studying AND passing, and the probability of a student studying.

##### **2.2. Bayes\' Theorem Explained**

*   **Explanation:** Bayes\' Theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It\'s a way to update your beliefs (probabilities) about a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. It essentially allows us to reverse conditional probabilities.
*   **Intuition:** Imagine you have a hypothesis (e.g., "I have a rare disease"). You get some new evidence (e.g., a positive test result). Bayes\' Theorem tells you how to combine your initial belief in the hypothesis with the reliability of the new evidence to get a *revised* belief (the posterior probability).
*   **Mathematical Equation:**
    $$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} $$
    Where:
    *   $P(A|B)$ is the **Posterior Probability**: The probability of hypothesis A being true, given that evidence B has occurred. This is what we want to find.
    *   $P(B|A)$ is the **Likelihood**: The probability of observing evidence B, given that hypothesis A is true. This tells us how consistent the evidence is with our hypothesis.
    *   $P(A)$ is the **Prior Probability**: The initial probability of hypothesis A being true *before* observing any evidence B. This reflects our initial belief.
    *   $P(B)$ is the **Marginal Probability of Evidence**: The total probability of observing evidence B, regardless of whether A is true or not. It acts as a normalizing constant. This can often be calculated using the law of total probability: $P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)$, where $A^c$ is the complement of A (i.e., A is false).

*   **Example (Medical Diagnosis):**
    Suppose a rare disease affects 1 in 1000 people ($P(Disease) = 0.001$). There\'s a test for it that has:
    *   A **true positive rate** (sensitivity) of 99%: $P(Positive | Disease) = 0.99$.
    *   A **false positive rate** of 5%: $P(Positive | No Disease) = 0.05$. (This means if you don\'t have the disease, there\'s still a 5% chance the test says you do).

    You test positive. What is the probability that you actually have the disease? ($P(Disease | Positive)$)

    Let:
    *   $A = \text{Disease}$
    *   $B = \text{Positive Test}$

    We know:
    *   $P(A) = P(Disease) = 0.001$ (Prior probability)
    *   $P(A^c) = P(No Disease) = 1 - P(Disease) = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999$
    *   $P(B|A) = P(Positive | Disease) = 0.99$ (Likelihood)
    *   $P(B|A^c) = P(Positive | No Disease) = 0.05$ (False positive rate)

    First, calculate $P(B)$ (marginal probability of a positive test):
    $P(B) = P(Positive) = P(Positive | Disease)P(Disease) + P(Positive | No Disease)P(No Disease)$
    $P(B) = (0.99 \cdot 0.001) + (0.05 \cdot 0.999)$
    $P(B) = 0.00099 + 0.04995 = 0.05094$

    Now, apply Bayes\' Theorem:
    $P(Disease | Positive) = \frac{P(Positive | Disease) \cdot P(Disease)}{P(Positive)}$
    $P(Disease | Positive) = \frac{0.99 \cdot 0.001}{0.05094} = \frac{0.00099}{0.05094} \approx 0.0194$

    **Interpretation:** Even with a positive test result, the probability of actually having the disease is only about 1.94%! This seemingly counter-intuitive result arises because the disease is very rare ($P(Disease)$ is very small), and the false positive rate ($P(Positive | No Disease)$) is relatively high compared to the prior probability of the disease. This highlights the power of Bayes\' Theorem in making sense of probabilities in the context of new evidence.

*   **Python Implementation:**

    ```python
    # Define the probabilities
    p_disease = 0.001      # P(Disease): Prior probability of having the disease
    p_no_disease = 1 - p_disease # P(No Disease)

    p_pos_given_disease = 0.99 # P(Positive | Disease): True positive rate (sensitivity)
    p_pos_given_no_disease = 0.05 # P(Positive | No Disease): False positive rate

    # Calculate P(Positive) using the law of total probability
    p_positive = (p_pos_given_disease * p_disease) + (p_pos_given_no_disease * p_no_disease)
    print(f"P(Positive Test) = {p_positive:.5f}")

    # Apply Bayes' Theorem to find P(Disease | Positive)
    p_disease_given_pos = (p_pos_given_disease * p_disease) / p_positive
    print(f"P(Disease | Positive Test) = {p_disease_given_pos:.4f}")

    # Let's consider a scenario with a much more common disease
    print("\n--- Scenario: More Common Disease (e.g., 10% prevalence) ---")
    p_disease_common = 0.1
    p_no_disease_common = 1 - p_disease_common

    p_positive_common = (p_pos_given_disease * p_disease_common) + (p_pos_given_no_disease * p_no_disease_common)
    p_disease_given_pos_common = (p_pos_given_disease * p_disease_common) / p_positive_common
    print(f"P(Positive Test) = {p_positive_common:.4f}")
    print(f"P(Disease | Positive Test) = {p_disease_given_pos_common:.4f}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    P(Positive Test) = 0.05094
    P(Disease | Positive Test) = 0.0194

    --- Scenario: More Common Disease (e.g., 10% prevalence) ---
    P(Positive Test) = 0.1440
    P(Disease | Positive Test) = 0.6875
    ```
    **Interpretation of Second Scenario:** When the disease is more common (10% prevalence), a positive test result makes it much more likely you have the disease (68.75% probability). This demonstrates how crucial the prior probability is in Bayesian inference.

#### **Sub-topic 1.4: Linear Algebra**

**Overview:**
Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear mappings between those spaces. In Data Science, it's indispensable for:
*   **Data Representation:** Datasets are often represented as matrices, with rows as observations and columns as features.
*   **Transformations:** Many machine learning algorithms perform linear transformations on data (e.g., rotation, scaling, projection).
*   **Optimisation:** Gradient descent and other optimization techniques rely heavily on vector and matrix operations.
*   **Algorithm Foundations:** Concepts like principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), and neural networks are deeply rooted in linear algebra.

Let's start with the basic elements.

---

#### **1. Vectors**

##### **1.1. Explanation**

A vector is an ordered list of numbers. Geometrically, it can be thought of as an arrow in space, starting from the origin and pointing to a specific coordinate. It has both **magnitude** (length) and **direction**. In Data Science, a vector often represents a single data point (an observation) where each number in the vector is a feature, or it can represent a feature itself across all data points.

*   **Row Vector:** $[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$
*   **Column Vector:** $\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ \vdots \\ x_n \end{pmatrix}$

By convention in linear algebra, vectors are typically written as column vectors. The 'dimension' or 'size' of a vector is the number of elements it contains.

##### **1.2. Mathematical Intuition & Equations**

For a vector $\mathbf{v}$ in $n$-dimensional space:
$$ \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix} $$

*   **Vector Addition:** Element-wise addition.
    If $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}$, then $\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1+b_1 \\ a_2+b_2 \end{pmatrix}$.
    *   **Geometric Intuition:** Placing vectors head-to-tail.
*   **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying a vector by a scalar (a single number) scales its length.
    If $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $c$ is a scalar, then $c \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} c a_1 \\ c a_2 \end{pmatrix}$.
    *   **Geometric Intuition:** Stretching or shrinking the vector. If $c$ is negative, it reverses the direction.
*   **Magnitude (Euclidean Norm / L2 Norm):** The length of the vector.
    For $\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{pmatrix}$, the magnitude is denoted as $\| \mathbf{v} \|$ and calculated as:
    $$ \| \mathbf{v} \| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \dots + v_n^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i^2} $$

##### **1.3. Python Implementation**

In Python, NumPy arrays are the standard way to represent vectors.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define two vectors
v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(f"Vector 1: {v1}")
print(f"Vector 2: {v2}")

# Vector Addition
v_sum = v1 + v2
print(f"Vector Sum (v1 + v2): {v_sum}")

# Scalar Multiplication
scalar = 2
v1_scaled = scalar * v1
print(f"Vector 1 scaled by {scalar}: {v1_scaled}")

#### **2. Matrices**

##### **2.1. Explanation**

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions arranged in rows and columns. It's essentially a generalization of a vector to two dimensions.

*   An $m \times n$ (read "m by n") matrix has $m$ rows and $n$ columns.
*   Individual elements are denoted by $a_{ij}$, where $i$ is the row index and $j$ is the column index.

In Data Science, a matrix is often used to represent an entire dataset, where each row is an observation (or data point, a vector), and each column is a feature (also a vector).

##### **2.2. Mathematical Intuition & Equations**

For an $m \times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$:
$$ \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \dots & a_{mn} \end{pmatrix} $$

*   **Matrix Addition/Subtraction:** Element-wise, only possible if matrices have the same dimensions.
    If $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} \end{pmatrix}$, then $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11}+b_{11} & a_{12}+b_{12} \\ a_{21}+b_{21} & a_{22}+b_{22} \end{pmatrix}$.
*   **Scalar Multiplication:** Multiplying every element in the matrix by a scalar.
    If $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ and $c$ is a scalar, then $c \mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} c a_{11} & c a_{12} \\ c a_{21} & c a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$.
*   **Transpose:** Swapping rows and columns. The element $a_{ij}$ becomes $a_{ji}$ in the transpose, denoted $\mathbf{A}^T$.
    If $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$, then $\mathbf{A}^T = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$.
    *   If $\mathbf{A}$ is $m \times n$, then $\mathbf{A}^T$ is $n \times m$.

##### **2.3. Python Implementation**

NumPy 2D arrays (or higher-dimensional arrays) are used for matrices.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define two matrices
A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4]])

B = np.array([[5, 6],
              [7, 8]])

print(f"Matrix A:\n{A}")
print(f"Matrix B:\n{B}")

# Matrix Addition
C_sum = A + B
print(f"\nMatrix Sum (A + B):\n{C_sum}")

# Scalar Multiplication
scalar_val = 3
A_scaled = scalar_val * A
print(f"\nMatrix A scaled by {scalar_val}:\n{A_scaled}")

# Transpose of a matrix
A_T = A.T
print(f"\nTranspose of A (A_T):\n{A_T}")
print(f"Shape of A: {A.shape}")
print(f"Shape of A_T: {A_T.shape}")

# Example: A dataset with 3 observations and 2 features
dataset = np.array([[10, 20],
                    [15, 25],
                    [12, 22]])
print(f"\nDataset Matrix (3 observations, 2 features):\n{dataset}")
```

**Output:**
```
Matrix A:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
Matrix B:
[[5 6]
 [7 8]]

Matrix Sum (A + B):
[[ 6  8]
 [10 12]]

Matrix A scaled by 3:
[[ 3  6]
 [ 9 12]]

Transpose of A (A_T):
[[1 3]
 [2 4]]
Shape of A: (2, 2)
Shape of A_T: (2, 2)

Dataset Matrix (3 observations, 2 features):
[[10 20]
 [15 25]
 [12 22]]
```

#### **3. Dot Product (Vector Dot Product)**

##### **3.1. Explanation**

The dot product (also known as the scalar product) is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (vectors) and returns a single number (a scalar).

##### **3.2. Mathematical Intuition & Equations**

For two vectors $\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ \vdots \\ b_n \end{pmatrix}$:
$$ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + \dots + a_n b_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i b_i $$

*   **Geometric Intuition:** The dot product is related to the angle between the two vectors.
    $$ \mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \| \mathbf{a} \| \| \mathbf{b} \| \cos(\theta) $$
    Where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$.
    *   If $\theta = 0^\circ$ (vectors point in the same direction), $\cos(0) = 1$, so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \| \mathbf{a} \| \| \mathbf{b} \|$ (maximum positive value).
    *   If $\theta = 90^\circ$ (vectors are orthogonal/perpendicular), $\cos(90) = 0$, so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0$. This is a crucial property for independence in data.
    *   If $\theta = 180^\circ$ (vectors point in opposite directions), $\cos(180) = -1$, so $\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = -\| \mathbf{a} \| \| \mathbf{b} \|$ (maximum negative value).

The dot product can be seen as a measure of how much two vectors "point in the same direction" or their "similarity." It's fundamental in calculations like cosine similarity (e.g., in recommendation systems or text analysis).

##### **3.3. Python Implementation**

NumPy provides `np.dot()` or the `@` operator for dot products.

```python
import numpy as np

v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Calculate dot product
dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)
# Alternatively, using the @ operator (more common in modern Python for matrix multiplication)
dot_product_at = v1 @ v2

print(f"Vector 1: {v1}")
print(f"Vector 2: {v2}")
print(f"Dot product of v1 and v2: {dot_product}")
print(f"Dot product using @ operator: {dot_product_at}")

# Example of orthogonal vectors (dot product is 0)
orthogonal_v1 = np.array([1, 0])
orthogonal_v2 = np.array([0, 1])
dot_orthogonal = orthogonal_v1 @ orthogonal_v2
print(f"\nOrthogonal vectors v1: {orthogonal_v1}, v2: {orthogonal_v2}")
print(f"Dot product of orthogonal vectors: {dot_orthogonal}")
```

**Output:**
```
Vector 1: [1 2 3]
Vector 2: [4 5 6]
Dot product of v1 and v2: 32
Dot product using @ operator: 32

Orthogonal vectors v1: [1 0], v2: [0 1]
Dot product of orthogonal vectors: 0
```

#### **4. Matrix Multiplication**

##### **4.1. Explanation**

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation that combines two matrices to produce a third matrix. Unlike element-wise multiplication, it involves a sum of products.

##### **4.2. Mathematical Intuition & Equations**

For two matrices $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to be multiplied to form $\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B}$, the number of columns in $\mathbf{A}$ must equal the number of rows in $\mathbf{B}$.
*   If $\mathbf{A}$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, and $\mathbf{B}$ is an $n \times p$ matrix, then the resulting matrix $\mathbf{C}$ will be an $m \times p$ matrix.
*   Each element $c_{ij}$ in $\mathbf{C}$ is calculated by taking the dot product of the $i$-th row of $\mathbf{A}$ and the $j$-th column of $\mathbf{B}$.

$$ c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik} b_{kj} $$

**Example:**
If $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} \end{pmatrix}$, then
$$ \mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11}b_{11} + a_{12}b_{21} & a_{11}b_{12} + a_{12}b_{22} \\ a_{21}b_{11} + a_{22}b_{21} & a_{21}b_{12} + a_{22}b_{22} \end{pmatrix} $$

*   **Non-Commutativity:** In general, $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{B} \ne \mathbf{B} \mathbf{A}$. The order matters!
*   **Geometric Intuition:** Matrix multiplication can represent a sequence of linear transformations. For example, applying matrix B then matrix A to a vector is equivalent to applying matrix C=AB to the vector.

##### **4.3. Python Implementation**

NumPy\'s `np.dot()` function or the `@` operator are used for matrix multiplication. The `@` operator is preferred for its readability and explicit meaning in Python for matrix multiplication.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define two matrices
A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4]]) # 2x2 matrix

B = np.array([[5, 6],
              [7, 8]]) # 2x2 matrix

C = np.array([[1, 0, 1],
              [0, 1, 1]]) # 2x3 matrix

D = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4],
              [5, 6]]) # 3x2 matrix

print(f"Matrix A:\n{A}")
print(f"Matrix B:\n{B}")
print(f"Matrix C:\n{C}")
print(f"Matrix D:\n{D}")

# Matrix A * B (2x2 * 2x2 -> 2x2)
product_AB = A @ B
print(f"\nProduct of A and B (A @ B):\n{product_AB}")

# Matrix C * D (2x3 * 3x2 -> 2x2)
product_CD = C @ D
print(f"\nProduct of C and D (C @ D):\n{product_CD}")

# Matrix B * A (demonstrates non-commutativity)
product_BA = B @ A
print(f"\nProduct of B and A (B @ A):\n{product_BA}")
print(f"Is A @ B == B @ A? {np.array_equal(product_AB, product_BA)}") # Should be False

# Matrix-vector multiplication (matrix @ vector)
v = np.array([1, 0])
product_Av = A @ v
print(f"\nProduct of A and vector v ({v}): {product_Av}")
```

**Output:**
```
Matrix A:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
Matrix B:
[[5 6]
 [7 8]]
Matrix C:
[[1 0 1]
 [0 1 1]]
Matrix D:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]
 [5 6]]

Product of A and B (A @ B):
[[19 22]
 [43 50]]

Product of C and D (C @ D):
[[ 6  8]
 [ 8 10]]

Product of B and A (B @ A):
[[23 34]
 [31 46]]
Is A @ B == B @ A? False

Product of A and vector v ([1 0]): [1 3]
```

#### **5. Determinants**

##### **5.1. Explanation**

The determinant is a special scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a **square matrix**. It provides important information about the matrix, particularly regarding its invertibility and the geometric scaling effect of the linear transformation it represents.

##### **5.2. Mathematical Intuition & Equations**

*   **Geometric Intuition:**
    *   For a $2 \times 2$ matrix, the absolute value of the determinant represents the area of the parallelogram formed by its column (or row) vectors.
    *   For a $3 \times 3$ matrix, it represents the volume of the parallelepiped.
    *   In general, for an $n \times n$ matrix, it represents the scaling factor of the $n$-dimensional volume under the linear transformation represented by the matrix.
*   **Invertibility:** A matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is invertible (meaning it has an inverse $\mathbf{A}^{-1}$) if and only if its determinant is non-zero ($\det(\mathbf{A}) \ne 0$). If $\det(\mathbf{A}) = 0$, the matrix is called singular, and it implies that the transformation collapses dimensions (e.g., squashes an area or volume to zero), meaning there's no unique way to reverse the transformation.

**Formulas:**

*   **For a $2 \times 2$ matrix:** $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$
    $$ \det(\mathbf{A}) = ad - bc $$
*   **For a $3 \times 3$ matrix (using Sarrus' Rule, or more generally, cofactor expansion):**
    $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{pmatrix}$
    $$ \det(\mathbf{A}) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) $$

##### **5.3. Python Implementation**

NumPy\'s `np.linalg.det()` function computes the determinant.

```python
import numpy as np

# 2x2 matrix
A_2x2 = np.array([[1, 2],
                  [3, 4]])
det_A_2x2 = np.linalg.det(A_2x2)
print(f"Matrix A_2x2:\n{A_2x2}")
print(f"Determinant of A_2x2: {det_A_2x2:.2f}")

# 3x3 matrix
A_3x3 = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                  [4, 5, 6],
                  [7, 8, 9]])
det_A_3x3 = np.linalg.det(A_3x3)
print(f"\nMatrix A_3x3:\n{A_3x3}")
print(f"Determinant of A_3x3: {det_A_3x3:.2f}") # This will be very close to 0 due to linear dependence

# Example of a singular matrix (determinant is 0)
# Here, the second row is a multiple of the first (2 * [1, 2] = [2, 4])
singular_matrix = np.array([[1, 2],
                            [2, 4]])
det_singular = np.linalg.det(singular_matrix)
print(f"\nSingular Matrix:\n{singular_matrix}")
print(f"Determinant of singular matrix: {det_singular:.2f}") # Will be 0
```

**Output:**
```
Matrix A_2x2:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
Determinant of A_2x2: -2.00

Matrix A_3x3:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
Determinant of A_3x3: 0.00 # Note: Due to floating point precision, it might be a tiny number like -6.67e-16

Singular Matrix:
[[1 2]
 [2 4]]
Determinant of singular matrix: 0.00
```
**Discussion on `A_3x3` determinant:** The determinant of `A_3x3` being 0 (or very close to 0 due to floating point arithmetic) implies that its rows/columns are linearly dependent. Specifically, `[7, 8, 9]` is `[1, 2, 3] + 2 * [3, 3, 3] + [0, 0, 0]` - it is a linear combination of other rows. This means the matrix transformation squashes 3D space into a 2D plane or lower, and it is not invertible.

---

#### **6. Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**

##### **6.1. Explanation**

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are perhaps the most conceptually challenging but profoundly important concepts in linear algebra for data science. They help us understand the inherent structure and behavior of linear transformations represented by matrices.

*   An **Eigenvector** is a non-zero vector that, when a linear transformation (represented by a matrix) is applied to it, only changes in magnitude (is scaled), but not in direction. It remains on the same span.
*   An **Eigenvalue** is the scalar factor by which an eigenvector is scaled during this transformation.

Not all matrices have real eigenvalues and eigenvectors. They are primarily defined for square matrices.

##### **6.2. Mathematical Intuition & Equations**

The relationship between a matrix $\mathbf{A}$, its eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$, and its eigenvalue $\lambda$ is defined by the equation:
$$ \mathbf{A} \mathbf{v} = \lambda \mathbf{v} $$
Where:
*   $\mathbf{A}$ is a square matrix (the transformation).
*   $\mathbf{v}$ is the eigenvector.
*   $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue (a scalar).

This equation means that when matrix $\mathbf{A}$ transforms vector $\mathbf{v}$, the result is simply a scaled version of $\mathbf{v}$. $\mathbf{v}$ is a "special direction" in the space that the transformation acts upon.

**Intuition & Applications:**
*   **Principle Component Analysis (PCA):** In PCA, eigenvectors of the covariance matrix represent the principal components (directions of maximum variance in the data), and their corresponding eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance along those directions. This is fundamental for dimensionality reduction.
*   **Facial Recognition:** Eigenfaces are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of a set of facial images, representing key features for recognition.
*   **PageRank Algorithm:** The core of Google's original search algorithm uses eigenvalues and eigenvectors to rank web pages.
*   **Quantum Mechanics & Engineering:** Essential in many scientific and engineering fields for analyzing systems' natural frequencies and modes.

##### **6.3. Python Implementation**

NumPy's `np.linalg.eig()` function computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix. It returns two arrays: one containing the eigenvalues and one containing the corresponding eigenvectors (as columns).

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a square matrix
M = np.array([[2, 1],
              [1, 2]])

print(f"Matrix M:\n{M}")

# Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(M)

print(f"\nEigenvalues: {eigenvalues}")
print(f"Eigenvectors (columns):\n{eigenvectors}")

# Verify the relationship: M @ v = lambda * v for the first eigenvector/eigenvalue pair
# First eigenvector is the first column of the eigenvectors matrix
v1 = eigenvectors[:, 0]
lambda1 = eigenvalues[0]

Mv1 = M @ v1
lambda_v1 = lambda1 * v1

print(f"\nVerification for first eigenpair:")
print(f"M @ v1: {Mv1}")
print(f"lambda1 * v1: {lambda_v1}")
print(f"Are M @ v1 and lambda1 * v1 approximately equal? {np.allclose(Mv1, lambda_v1)}")

# Verification for second eigenpair
v2 = eigenvectors[:, 1]
lambda2 = eigenvalues[1]

Mv2 = M @ v2
lambda_v2 = lambda2 * v2

print(f"\nVerification for second eigenpair:")
print(f"M @ v2: {Mv2}")
print(f"lambda2 * v2: {lambda_v2}")
print(f"Are M @ v2 and lambda2 * v2 approximately equal? {np.allclose(Mv2, lambda_v2)}")
```

**Output:**
```
Matrix M:
[[2 1]
 [1 2]]

Eigenvalues: [3. 1.]
Eigenvectors (columns):
[[ 0.70710678 -0.70710678]
 [ 0.70710678  0.70710678]]

Verification for first eigenpair:
M @ v1: [2.12132034 2.12132034]
lambda1 * v1: [2.12132034 2.12132034]
Are M @ v1 and lambda1 * v1 approximately equal? True

Verification for second eigenpair:
M @ v2: [-0.70710678  0.70710678]
lambda2 * v2: [-0.70710678  0.70710678]
Are M @ v2 and lambda2 * v2 approximately equal? True
```
**Interpretation:**
The matrix `M` has two eigenvalues (3 and 1) and two corresponding eigenvectors. When `M` transforms its first eigenvector `[0.707, 0.707]`, the resulting vector is `[2.121, 2.121]`, which is exactly 3 times the original eigenvector (scaled by the eigenvalue 3), but still pointing in the same direction. The same applies to the second eigenpair with a scaling factor of 1.

#### **Sub-topic 1.5: Python Programming Fundamentals**

**Overview:**
Python is the most popular programming language in Data Science due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and strong community support. Understanding its fundamentals is essential for everything from data manipulation and analysis to building complex machine learning models. This section will cover the core building blocks of Python: how data is stored (data types), how programs make decisions (conditionals), how actions are repeated (loops), how to organize code (functions), and how to manage collections of data (data structures).

---

#### **1. Basic Data Types**

Data types classify what kind of value a variable holds, and this classification determines what operations can be performed on it. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare the type of a variable; Python infers it.

##### **1.1. Integers (`int`)**
*   **Explanation:** Whole numbers, positive or negative, without a decimal point.
*   **Intuition:** Used for counting discrete items.
*   **Example:** `5`, `-100`, `0`
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    age = 30
    num_students = 150
    print(f"Age: {age}, Type: {type(age)}")
    print(f"Number of Students: {num_students}, Type: {type(num_students)}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Age: 30, Type: <class 'int'>
    Number of Students: 150, Type: <class 'int'>
    ```

##### **1.2. Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)**
*   **Explanation:** Numbers with a decimal point, representing real numbers.
*   **Intuition:** Used for measurements, percentages, or values that can have fractional parts.
*   **Example:** `3.14`, `-0.5`, `100.0`
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    price = 19.99
    pi = 3.14159
    print(f"Price: {price}, Type: {type(price)}")
    print(f"Pi: {pi}, Type: {type(pi)}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Price: 19.99, Type: <class 'float'>
    Pi: 3.14159, Type: <class 'float'>
    ```

##### **1.3. Strings (`str`)**
*   **Explanation:** Sequences of characters (letters, numbers, symbols). Used to represent text. Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.
*   **Intuition:** Any textual information – names, addresses, descriptions.
*   **Example:** `"Hello World"`, `'Data Science'`, `"123"`
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    name = "Alice"
    message = 'Welcome to Python!'
    print(f"Name: {name}, Type: {type(name)}")
    print(f"Message: {message}, Type: {type(message)}")

    # String concatenation
    greeting = name + ": " + message
    print(f"Greeting: {greeting}")

    # String length
    print(f"Length of name: {len(name)}")

    # Accessing characters (indexing)
    print(f"First character of name: {name[0]}") # Python uses 0-based indexing
    print(f"Last character of name: {name[-1]}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Name: Alice, Type: <class 'str'>
    Message: Welcome to Python!, Type: <class 'str'>
    Greeting: Alice: Welcome to Python!
    Length of name: 5
    First character of name: A
    Last character of name: e
    ```

##### **1.4. Booleans (`bool`)**
*   **Explanation:** Represents one of two values: `True` or `False`. Used for logical operations.
*   **Intuition:** Yes/No, On/Off, True/False conditions.
*   **Example:** `True`, `False`
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    is_active = True
    has_permission = False
    print(f"Is Active: {is_active}, Type: {type(is_active)}")
    print(f"Has Permission: {has_permission}, Type: {type(has_permission)}")

    # Logical operations
    print(f"Is Active AND Has Permission: {is_active and has_permission}")
    print(f"Is Active OR Has Permission: {is_active or has_permission}")
    print(f"NOT Has Permission: {not has_permission}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Is Active: True, Type: <class 'bool'>
    Has Permission: False, Type: <class 'bool'>
    Is Active AND Has Permission: False
    Is Active OR Has Permission: True
    NOT Has Permission: True
    ```
*   **Quick Note on Operators:**
    *   **Arithmetic:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (integer division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation).
    *   **Comparison:** `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to), `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`. These return boolean values.
    *   **Logical:** `and`, `or`, `not` (used with boolean values).
    *   **Assignment:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.

#### **2. Control Flow: Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)**

Conditionals allow your program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are met.

*   **Explanation:** An `if` statement evaluates a condition. If `True`, the code block beneath it executes. `elif` (else if) provides additional conditions to check if the preceding `if`/`elif` conditions were `False`. `else` provides a default block to execute if all preceding conditions were `False`.
*   **Intuition:** Like a flowchart or a decision tree: "If this is true, do X. Else if that is true, do Y. Otherwise, do Z."
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    score = 85

    if score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 80: # This runs only if score < 90
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 70: # This runs only if score < 80
        grade = "C"
    else: # This runs if score < 70
        grade = "F"

    print(f"With a score of {score}, the grade is: {grade}")

    temperature = 28 # Celsius

    if temperature > 30:
        print("It's a hot day!")
    elif 20 <= temperature <= 30: # Check if temp is between 20 and 30 inclusive
        print("It's a pleasant day.")
    else:
        print("It's a cold day.")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    With a score of 85, the grade is: B
    It's a pleasant day.
    ```

#### **3. Control Flow: Loops (`for`, `while`)**

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times. This is essential for processing collections of data or repeating tasks.

##### **3.1. `for` Loop**
*   **Explanation:** Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or other iterable objects. It executes a block of code once for each item in the sequence.
*   **Intuition:** "For each item in this collection, do something."
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

    print("Iterating through fruits:")
    for fruit in fruits:
        print(f"  I love {fruit}s.")

    # Using range() for a fixed number of iterations
    print("\nCounting from 0 to 4:")
    for i in range(5): # range(n) generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) n
        print(f"  Count: {i}")

    # Iterating with index using enumerate
    print("\nIterating with index:")
    for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
        print(f"  Fruit at index {index}: {fruit}")

    # Looping through a string
    word = "Python"
    print("\nCharacters in 'Python':")
    for char in word:
        print(f"  {char}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Iterating through fruits:
      I love apples.
      I love bananas.
      I love cherrys.

    Counting from 0 to 4:
      Count: 0
      Count: 1
      Count: 2
      Count: 3
      Count: 4

    Iterating with index:
      Fruit at index 0: apple
      Fruit at index 1: banana
      Fruit at index 2: cherry

    Characters in 'Python':
      P
      y
      t
      h
      o
      n
    ```

##### **3.2. `while` Loop**
*   **Explanation:** Executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition remains `True`. It's crucial to ensure the condition eventually becomes `False` to avoid an infinite loop.
*   **Intuition:** "Keep doing this as long as this condition is met."
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    count = 0
    print("Counting up to 3:")
    while count < 4:
        print(f"  Current count: {count}")
        count += 1 # Increment count to eventually make the condition False

    # Example with break and continue
    print("\nLoop with break and continue:")
    i = 0
    while True: # Infinite loop, must use 'break'
        if i == 3:
            i += 1
            continue # Skip the rest of this iteration, go to the next
        if i >= 6:
            break # Exit the loop entirely
        print(f"  Processing item {i}")
        i += 1
    print("Loop finished.")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Counting up to 3:
      Current count: 0
      Current count: 1
      Current count: 2
      Current count: 3

    Loop with break and continue:
      Processing item 0
      Processing item 1
      Processing item 2
      Processing item 4
      Processing item 5
    Loop finished.
    ```

#### **4. Functions**

Functions are named blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help organize code, make it more readable, and prevent repetition (DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself principle).

*   **Explanation:** You define a function using the `def` keyword, give it a name, specify any parameters it takes, and then write the code block. Functions can return values using the `return` statement.
*   **Intuition:** Like a specialized machine or a recipe. You give it inputs (ingredients), it performs a process, and gives you an output (finished dish).
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    # Simple function without parameters or return value
    def greet():
        print("Hello, Data Scientist!")

    greet() # Call the function

    # Function with a parameter
    def greet_name(name):
        print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to the module.")

    greet_name("Charlie")
    greet_name("David")

    # Function with parameters and a return value
    def add_numbers(a, b):
        sum_result = a + b
        return sum_result # The result is sent back to where the function was called

    result = add_numbers(10, 25)
    print(f"The sum of 10 and 25 is: {result}")
    print(f"The sum of 5 and 7 is: {add_numbers(5, 7)}")

    # Function with default parameters
    def calculate_power(base, exponent=2): # exponent defaults to 2 if not provided
        return base ** exponent

    print(f"5 to the power of 2 (default): {calculate_power(5)}")
    print(f"5 to the power of 3: {calculate_power(5, 3)}")

    # Function with multiple return values (returns a tuple)
    def calculate_stats(numbers):
        if not numbers:
            return None, None # Handle empty list
        total = sum(numbers)
        count = len(numbers)
        average = total / count
        return total, average, count # Returns a tuple

    data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    total_val, avg_val, count_val = calculate_stats(data)
    print(f"\nData: {data}")
    print(f"Total: {total_val}, Average: {avg_val}, Count: {count_val}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Hello, Data Scientist!
    Hello, Charlie! Welcome to the module.
    Hello, David! Welcome to the module.
    The sum of 10 and 25 is: 35
    The sum of 5 and 7 is: 12
    5 to the power of 2 (default): 25
    5 to the power of 3: 125

    Data: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    Total: 150, Average: 30.0, Count: 5
    ```

#### **5. Data Structures**

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. Python provides several built-in data structures that are incredibly useful.

##### **5.1. Lists (`list`)**
*   **Explanation:** Ordered, mutable (changeable) sequences of items. Items can be of different data types and can contain duplicate values. Defined using square brackets `[]`.
*   **Intuition:** A dynamic shopping list where you can add, remove, or change items.
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    # Creating lists
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello", True, 3.14]
    empty_list = []
    print(f"My List: {my_list}")

    # Accessing elements (indexing - 0-based)
    print(f"First element: {my_list[0]}")
    print(f"Last element: {my_list[-1]}")

    # Slicing (start:end:step) - end is exclusive
    print(f"Elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive): {my_list[1:4]}")
    print(f"Elements from beginning to index 2 (exclusive): {my_list[:2]}")
    print(f"Elements from index 3 to end: {my_list[3:]}")
    print(f"All elements (copy): {my_list[:]}")
    print(f"Reverse list: {my_list[::-1]}")

    # Modifying elements (mutable)
    my_list[0] = 100
    print(f"List after changing first element: {my_list}")

    # Adding elements
    my_list.append("new item") # Adds to the end
    print(f"List after append: {my_list}")
    my_list.insert(2, "inserted_item") # Inserts at a specific index
    print(f"List after insert: {my_list}")

    # Removing elements
    my_list.remove("hello") # Removes the first occurrence of the value
    print(f"List after remove 'hello': {my_list}")
    popped_item = my_list.pop() # Removes and returns the last item
    print(f"List after pop: {my_list}, Popped item: {popped_item}")
    popped_at_index = my_list.pop(1) # Removes and returns item at specific index
    print(f"List after pop at index 1: {my_list}, Popped item: {popped_at_index}")

    # List length
    print(f"Length of list: {len(my_list)}")

    # Checking for existence
    print(f"Is 100 in my_list? {100 in my_list}")
    print(f"Is 'Python' in my_list? {'Python' in my_list}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    My List: [1, 2, 3, 'hello', True, 3.14]
    First element: 1
    Last element: 3.14
    Elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive): [2, 3, 'hello']
    Elements from beginning to index 2 (exclusive): [1, 2]
    Elements from index 3 to end: ['hello', True, 3.14]
    All elements (copy): [1, 2, 3, 'hello', True, 3.14]
    Reverse list: [3.14, True, 'hello', 3, 2, 1]
    List after changing first element: [100, 2, 3, 'hello', True, 3.14]
    List after append: [100, 2, 3, 'hello', True, 3.14, 'new item']
    List after insert: [100, 2, 'inserted_item', 3, 'hello', True, 3.14, 'new item']
    List after remove 'hello': [100, 2, 'inserted_item', 3, True, 3.14, 'new item']
    List after pop: [100, 2, 'inserted_item', 3, True, 3.14], Popped item: new item
    List after pop at index 1: [100, 'inserted_item', 3, True, 3.14], Popped item: 2
    Length of list: 6
    Is 100 in my_list? True
    Is 'Python' in my_list? False
    ```

##### **5.2. Tuples (`tuple`)**
*   **Explanation:** Ordered, immutable (unchangeable) sequences of items. Like lists, they can contain different data types and duplicates. Defined using parentheses `()`.
*   **Intuition:** Fixed records, like coordinates (latitude, longitude) or RGB color values (red, green, blue), which shouldn't change once defined.
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    # Creating tuples
    my_tuple = (1, "apple", 3.14, False)
    single_element_tuple = (5,) # Comma is essential for single-element tuple
    empty_tuple = ()
    print(f"My Tuple: {my_tuple}")

    # Accessing elements (indexing and slicing are same as lists)
    print(f"First element: {my_tuple[0]}")
    print(f"Slice from index 1 to 3: {my_tuple[1:3]}")

    # Immutability demonstration
    try:
        my_tuple[0] = 100
    except TypeError as e:
        print(f"\nError trying to modify tuple: {e}")

    # Tuple packing and unpacking
    coordinates = (10, 20, 30)
    x, y, z = coordinates # Unpacking
    print(f"X: {x}, Y: {y}, Z: {z}")

    # Functions returning multiple values implicitly return a tuple
    def get_user_info():
        return "John Doe", 30, "Software Engineer"
    name, age, occupation = get_user_info()
    print(f"User: {name}, Age: {age}, Occupation: {occupation}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    My Tuple: (1, 'apple', 3.14, False)
    First element: 1
    Slice from index 1 to 3: ('apple', 3.14)

    Error trying to modify tuple: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
    X: 10, Y: 20, Z: 30
    User: John Doe, Age: 30, Occupation: Software Engineer
    ```

##### **5.3. Dictionaries (`dict`)**
*   **Explanation:** Unordered (prior to Python 3.7), ordered (Python 3.7+), mutable collections of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples). Values can be of any data type and can be duplicated. Defined using curly braces `{}`.
*   **Intuition:** A real-world dictionary (word:definition), a phone book (name:number), or a JSON object.
*   **Python:**
    ```python
    # Creating dictionaries
    person = {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 25,
        "city": "New York",
        "is_student": True,
        "courses": ["Math", "Physics"]
    }
    empty_dict = {}
    print(f"Person Dictionary: {person}")

    # Accessing values by key
    print(f"Alice's age: {person['age']}")
    print(f"Alice's city: {person.get('city')}") # .get() method returns None if key not found (safer)
    print(f"Alice's courses: {person['courses']}")

    # Adding or modifying elements
    person["email"] = "alice@example.com" # Add new key-value pair
    person["age"] = 26 # Modify existing value
    print(f"Dictionary after update: {person}")

    # Removing elements
    removed_age = person.pop("age") # Removes key and returns its value
    print(f"Dictionary after removing age: {person}, Removed age: {removed_age}")
    del person["city"] # Deletes key-value pair
    print(f"Dictionary after deleting city: {person}")

    # Iterating through a dictionary
    print("\nIterating through keys:")
    for key in person.keys():
        print(f"  Key: {key}")

    print("\nIterating through values:")
    for value in person.values():
        print(f"  Value: {value}")

    print("\nIterating through key-value pairs:")
    for key, value in person.items():
        print(f"  {key}: {value}")

    # Dictionary length
    print(f"Length of dictionary: {len(person)}")

    # Checking for key existence
    print(f"Is 'name' a key in person? {'name' in person}")
    print(f"Is 'city' a key in person? {'city' in person}")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Person Dictionary: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York', 'is_student': True, 'courses': ['Math', 'Physics']}
    Alice's age: 25
    Alice's city: New York
    Alice's courses: ['Math', 'Physics']
    Dictionary after update: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 26, 'city': 'New York', 'is_student': True, 'courses': ['Math', 'Physics'], 'email': 'alice@example.com'}
    Dictionary after removing age: {'name': 'Alice', 'city': 'New York', 'is_student': True, 'courses': ['Math', 'Physics'], 'email': 'alice@example.com'}, Removed age: 26
    Dictionary after deleting city: {'name': 'Alice', 'is_student': True, 'courses': ['Math', 'Physics'], 'email': 'alice@example.com'}

    Iterating through keys:
      name
      is_student
      courses
      email

    Iterating through values:
      Alice
      True
      ['Math', 'Physics']
      alice@example.com

    Iterating through key-value pairs:
      name: Alice
      is_student: True
      courses: ['Math', 'Physics']
      email: alice@example.com
    Length of dictionary: 4
    Is 'name' a key in person? True
    Is 'city' a key in person? False
    ```

### **Summarized Notes for Revision: Python Programming Fundamentals**

**1. Basic Data Types**
*   **`int`:** Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `-5`).
*   **`float`:** Numbers with decimal points (e.g., `3.14`, `10.0`).
*   **`str`:** Text sequences (e.g., `"hello"`, `'Python'`). Immutable. Supports indexing, slicing, concatenation.
*   **`bool`:** Logical values (`True`, `False`). Used in conditions and logical operations (`and`, `or`, `not`).
*   **Operators:** Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.), Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`), Logical (`and`, `or`, `not`).

**2. Control Flow: Conditionals**
*   **`if`:** Executes code if a condition is `True`.
*   **`elif` (else if):** Checks another condition if preceding `if`/`elif` were `False`.
*   **`else`:** Executes code if all preceding `if`/`elif` conditions were `False`.
*   **Intuition:** Decision-making, executing different paths based on conditions.

**3. Control Flow: Loops**
*   **`for` loop:**
    *   **Purpose:** Iterates over sequences (lists, tuples, strings, `range()`).
    *   **Intuition:** "For each item in this collection, do X."
    *   **Keywords:** `enumerate` (for index and value), `break` (exit loop), `continue` (skip current iteration).
*   **`while` loop:**
    *   **Purpose:** Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is `True`.
    *   **Intuition:** "Keep doing X as long as Y is true."
    *   **Caution:** Ensure condition eventually becomes `False` to avoid infinite loops.

**4. Functions**
*   **Purpose:** Reusable blocks of code to perform specific tasks. Improves modularity and readability, reduces redundancy.
*   **Definition:** `def function_name(parameters): ... return value`.
*   **Parameters:** Inputs to the function. Can have default values.
*   **Return Value:** Output of the function (can return multiple values as a tuple).
*   **Intuition:** Building custom tools.

**5. Data Structures**
*   **Lists (`list`):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Ordered, mutable, allows duplicates, heterogeneous.
    *   **Syntax:** `[item1, item2, ...]`
    *   **Operations:** Indexing, slicing, `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `len()`.
    *   **Intuition:** A dynamic, ordered collection.
*   **Tuples (`tuple`):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Ordered, **immutable**, allows duplicates, heterogeneous.
    *   **Syntax:** `(item1, item2, ...)` (comma needed for single-element tuple).
    *   **Operations:** Indexing, slicing. Cannot modify elements after creation.
    *   **Intuition:** Fixed-size records that should not change.
*   **Dictionaries (`dict`):**
    *   **Characteristics:** Key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable; values can be any type. Ordered (Python 3.7+), mutable.
    *   **Syntax:** `{"key1": value1, "key2": value2, ...}`
    *   **Operations:** Access values by key (`dict[key]` or `dict.get(key)`), add/modify elements, `pop()`, `del`, `keys()`, `values()`, `items()`, `len()`.
    *   **Intuition:** A mapping between unique keys and their associated values.

#### **Sub-topic 1.6: Essential Python Libraries (NumPy & Pandas)**

**Overview:**
While Python's built-in data types and structures are versatile, they aren't optimized for the kind of large-scale numerical computation and tabular data handling that data science demands. This is where NumPy and Pandas come in.

*   **NumPy (Numerical Python):** Provides an efficient way to store and operate on large arrays of numerical data. It's the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
*   **Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library):** Built on top of NumPy, Pandas provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools, most notably the `DataFrame`, which is perfect for tabular data.

Virtually every data science project in Python will leverage both of these libraries extensively.

---

### **1. NumPy: The Foundation for Numerical Computing**

NumPy's core is the `ndarray` (N-dimensional array) object. This array is a grid of values (all of the same type) and is indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. It's similar to Python lists but offers significant advantages for numerical operations:
*   **Performance:** NumPy arrays are implemented in C, making them much faster than standard Python lists for numerical operations, especially with large datasets.
*   **Memory Efficiency:** NumPy arrays consume less memory than Python lists for the same number of elements.
*   **Powerful Functions:** It provides a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

##### **1.1. The `ndarray` Object**

*   **Explanation:** An `ndarray` is a collection of items of the same type, laid out in a grid. The number of dimensions is the `ndim` attribute, and the `shape` attribute tells us the size of the array in each dimension.
*   **Intuition:** Think of it as a super-efficient container for numbers. A 1D array is like a list, a 2D array is like a matrix or a table, and higher-dimensional arrays are like cubes or even more complex structures.

*   **Python (Array Creation):**

    ```python
    import numpy as np # Standard convention to import numpy as np

    # 1. From Python lists
    list_1d = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    array_1d = np.array(list_1d)
    print(f"1D Array: {array_1d}")
    print(f"Type of 1D Array: {type(array_1d)}")

##### **1.2. Basic Array Operations**

NumPy allows you to perform mathematical operations on entire arrays element-wise, without writing explicit loops. This is called **vectorization** and is a key reason for NumPy's speed.

*   **Explanation:** You can apply arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`) directly to arrays, and they will be performed element by element. You can also perform operations between arrays of compatible shapes, and between arrays and single scalar values.
*   **Intuition:** Instead of adding each number in a list one by one, you just say "add 5 to this whole array!" and NumPy handles it efficiently.

*   **Python:**

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr1 = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40])
    arr2 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

    print(f"arr1: {arr1}")
    print(f"arr2: {arr2}\n")

    # Element-wise addition
    print(f"arr1 + arr2: {arr1 + arr2}")

    # Element-wise subtraction
    print(f"arr1 - arr2: {arr1 - arr2}")

    # Element-wise multiplication
    print(f"arr1 * arr2: {arr1 * arr2}") # Note: This is NOT matrix multiplication

    # Element-wise division
    print(f"arr1 / arr2: {arr1 / arr2}")

    # Scalar operations (broadcasts the scalar to all elements)
    print(f"arr1 + 5: {arr1 + 5}")
    print(f"arr2 * 2: {arr2 * 2}\n")

    # Matrix Multiplication (using @ operator or np.dot)
    mat1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    mat2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
    print(f"Matrix 1:\n{mat1}")
    print(f"Matrix 2:\n{mat2}\n")

    matrix_product = mat1 @ mat2 # Or np.dot(mat1, mat2)
    print(f"Matrix Product (mat1 @ mat2):\n{matrix_product}\n")

    # Universal Functions (ufuncs) - apply element-wise functions
    print(f"Square root of arr1: {np.sqrt(arr1)}")
    print(f"Sine of arr2: {np.sin(arr2)}")
    print(f"Exponential of arr2: {np.exp(arr2)}\n")

    # Aggregation Functions
    data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    print(f"Data: {data}")
    print(f"Sum of data: {np.sum(data)}")
    print(f"Mean of data: {np.mean(data)}")
    print(f"Max of data: {np.max(data)}")
    print(f"Min of data: {np.min(data)}")
    print(f"Standard Deviation of data: {np.std(data)}") # ddof=0 by default (population)
    print(f"Sample Standard Deviation of data: {np.std(data, ddof=1)}") # ddof=1 for sample
    print(f"Variance of data: {np.var(data)}") # ddof=0 by default (population)
    print(f"Sample Variance of data: {np.var(data, ddof=1)}") # ddof=1 for sample

    # Aggregation along an axis (for 2D arrays)
    matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    print(f"\nMatrix:\n{matrix}")
    print(f"Sum of all elements: {np.sum(matrix)}")
    print(f"Sum along columns (axis=0): {np.sum(matrix, axis=0)}") # [1+4, 2+5, 3+6]
    print(f"Sum along rows (axis=1): {np.sum(matrix, axis=1)}")   # [1+2+3, 4+5+6]
    print(f"Mean along columns (axis=0): {np.mean(matrix, axis=0)}")

    ```

##### **1.3. Indexing and Slicing**

Accessing specific elements or subsets of an array is crucial. NumPy's indexing and slicing work similarly to Python lists but with extensions for multiple dimensions.

*   **Explanation:**
    *   **Indexing:** Use square brackets to access individual elements. For 2D arrays, use `[row_index, col_index]`.
    *   **Slicing:** Use the colon operator (`:`) to select a range of elements. `[start:stop:step]` where `stop` is exclusive.
    *   **Boolean Indexing:** Use a boolean array to select elements that satisfy a condition.
    *   **Fancy Indexing:** Use an array of integers to select arbitrary rows/columns.

*   **Python:**

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
    print(f"Original 1D array: {arr}")

    # --- 1D Array Indexing & Slicing ---
    print(f"First element: {arr[0]}")
    print(f"Last element: {arr[-1]}")
    print(f"Elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive): {arr[1:4]}")
    print(f"Every other element: {arr[::2]}")
    print(f"Reverse array: {arr[::-1]}\n")

    # --- 2D Array Indexing & Slicing ---
    matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],
                       [5, 6, 7, 8],
                       [9, 10, 11, 12]])
    print(f"Original 2D matrix:\n{matrix}")

    # Accessing single element (row 1, col 2 - remember 0-based)
    print(f"Element at (row 1, col 2): {matrix[1, 2]}") # Value is 7

    # Accessing a full row
    print(f"First row: {matrix[0, :]}") # Or simply matrix[0]
    print(f"Last row: {matrix[-1]}\n")

    # Accessing a full column
    print(f"Second column: {matrix[:, 1]}") # Values 2, 6, 10
    print(f"Last column: {matrix[:, -1]}\n")

    # Sub-matrix (rows 0-1, cols 1-2)
    sub_matrix = matrix[0:2, 1:3]
    print(f"Sub-matrix (rows 0-1, cols 1-2):\n{sub_matrix}\n")

    # --- Boolean Indexing ---
    data_scores = np.array([65, 80, 72, 95, 58, 88])
    print(f"Data Scores: {data_scores}")

    # Select scores greater than 70
    passing_scores = data_scores[data_scores > 70]
    print(f"Passing scores (>70): {passing_scores}")

    # Select even scores
    even_scores = data_scores[data_scores % 2 == 0]
    print(f"Even scores: {even_scores}\n")

    # --- Fancy Indexing ---
    # Selecting specific rows (e.g., rows 0 and 2)
    selected_rows = matrix[[0, 2]]
    print(f"Selected rows (0 and 2):\n{selected_rows}")

    # Selecting specific columns (e.g., columns 0 and 3)
    selected_cols = matrix[:, [0, 3]]
    print(f"Selected columns (0 and 3):\n{selected_cols}\n")

    # Selecting specific elements using coordinate pairs
    # E.g., elements at (0,0), (1,2), (2,1)
    coords_elements = matrix[[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 1]]
    print(f"Elements at (0,0), (1,2), (2,1): {coords_elements}") # Values 1, 7, 10
    ```

### **2. Pandas: The Workhorse for Data Analysis**

Pandas is the go-to library for working with structured (tabular) data in Python. It provides two primary data structures:
*   **Series:** A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floats, Python objects, etc.). Think of it as a single column of a spreadsheet or a NumPy array with an index.
*   **DataFrame:** A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. You can think of it like a spreadsheet or SQL table, or a dictionary of Series objects. It is the most commonly used Pandas object.

##### **2.1. Pandas Series**

*   **Explanation:** A Series is a 1D array-like object containing a sequence of values (of similar types to NumPy arrays) and an associated array of data labels, called its *index*.
*   **Intuition:** A Series is like a single column from an Excel sheet. It has values and a label for each value (its index).

*   **Python:**

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # 1. Creating a Series from a list
    data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    s = pd.Series(data)
    print(f"Series from list:\n{s}\n")

    # 2. Creating a Series with a custom index
    s_indexed = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
    print(f"Series with custom index:\n{s_indexed}\n")

    # 3. Creating a Series from a dictionary
    data_dict = {'Math': 90, 'Science': 85, 'English': 92, 'History': 78}
    s_dict = pd.Series(data_dict)
    print(f"Series from dictionary:\n{s_dict}\n")

    # 4. Accessing elements in a Series
    print(f"Value at index 0 (positional): {s[0]}")
    print(f"Value at index 'Science' (label-based): {s_dict['Science']}\n")

    # 5. Series operations (NumPy-like vectorization)
    s_modified = s * 2
    print(f"Series after multiplication by 2:\n{s_modified}\n")

    # 6. Filtering a Series
    s_filtered = s_dict[s_dict > 85]
    print(f"Scores greater than 85:\n{s_filtered}\n")
    ```
    **Output:**
    ```
    Series from list:
    0    10
    1    20
    2    30
    3    40
    4    50
    dtype: int64

    Series with custom index:
    a    10
    b    20
    c    30
    d    40
    dtype: int64

    Series from dictionary:
    Math       90
    Science    85
    English    92
    History    78
    dtype: int64

    Value at index 0 (positional): 10
    Value at index 'Science' (label-based): 85

    Series after multiplication by 2:
    0     20
    1     40
    2     60
    3     80
    4    100
    dtype: int64

    Scores greater than 85:
    Math       90
    English    92
    dtype: int64
    ```

##### **2.2. Pandas DataFrame**

*   **Explanation:** A DataFrame is the most widely used Pandas object. It represents tabular data with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. Each column in a DataFrame is essentially a Pandas Series.
*   **Intuition:** This is your entire Excel sheet, or a database table. Each column has a name, each row has an index, and it's perfect for structured datasets.

*   **Python (DataFrame Creation & Inspection):**

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    # 1. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary of lists/Series
    data = {
        'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35, 28],
        'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston'],
        'Score': [88, 92, 75, 95]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print(f"DataFrame from dictionary:\n{df}\n")

    # 2. Creating a DataFrame from a list of dictionaries
    data_list = [
        {'Name': 'Eve', 'Age': 22, 'City': 'Boston'},
        {'Name': 'Frank', 'Age': 40, 'City': 'Seattle'}
    ]
    df_list = pd.DataFrame(data_list)
    print(f"DataFrame from list of dictionaries:\n{df_list}\n")

    # 3. Creating a DataFrame from a NumPy array (need to specify columns/index)
    numpy_data = np.random.randint(60, 100, size=(4, 3))
    df_numpy = pd.DataFrame(numpy_data, columns=['Math', 'Science', 'English'], index=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
    print(f"DataFrame from NumPy array:\n{df_numpy}\n")

    # --- Basic DataFrame Inspection ---
    print(f"First 2 rows (df.head()):\n{df.head(2)}\n") # Default is 5
    print(f"Last 2 rows (df.tail()):\n{df.tail(2)}\n")  # Default is 5

    print(f"DataFrame information (df.info()):")
    df.info()
    print("\n")

    print(f"Descriptive statistics (df.describe()):\n{df.describe()}\n") # Only for numerical columns

    print(f"DataFrame shape (rows, columns): {df.shape}")
    print(f"DataFrame columns: {df.columns.tolist()}")
    print(f"DataFrame index: {df.index.tolist()}\n")

    print(f"Data types of columns:\n{df.dtypes}\n")
    ```

### **Summarized Notes for Revision: Essential Python Libraries (NumPy & Pandas)**

**1. NumPy (Numerical Python)**
*   **Purpose:** Fast and efficient array computations. Core library for scientific computing in Python.
*   **Key Data Structure:** `ndarray` (N-dimensional array). All elements must be of the same data type.
*   **Advantages:** Performance (C implementation, vectorization), memory efficiency.
*   **Creation:**
    *   `np.array([list])`: From Python lists.
    *   `np.zeros((shape))`, `np.ones((shape))`, `np.full((shape), value)`
    *   `np.arange(start, stop, step)`: Sequence generation.
    *   `np.linspace(start, stop, num)`: Linearly spaced values.
    *   `np.random.rand()`, `np.random.randn()`, `np.random.randint()`: Random number generation.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `.ndim`: Number of dimensions.
    *   `.shape`: Tuple indicating size in each dimension (rows, columns, ...).
    *   `.size`: Total number of elements.
    *   `.dtype`: Data type of elements (e.g., `int64`, `float64`).
*   **Operations:**
    *   **Element-wise:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` (between arrays or array and scalar).
    *   **Matrix Multiplication:** `@` operator or `np.dot()`.
    *   **Universal Functions (ufuncs):** `np.sqrt()`, `np.sin()`, `np.exp()`, etc., applied element-wise.
    *   **Aggregation:** `np.sum()`, `np.mean()`, `np.max()`, `np.min()`, `np.std()`, `np.var()`. Can specify `axis=0` (columns) or `axis=1` (rows) for 2D arrays.
    *   **Sample vs. Population:** For `np.std()` and `np.var()`, use `ddof=1` for sample statistics (Bessel's correction).
*   **Indexing & Slicing:**
    *   Standard `[start:stop:step]` for 1D.
    *   `[row_index, col_index]` for 2D.
    *   `[row_slice, col_slice]` for sub-arrays.
    *   **Boolean Indexing:** `arr[arr > value]` to filter by condition.
    *   **Fancy Indexing:** `arr[[idx1, idx2]]` to select non-contiguous elements/rows/columns.

**2. Pandas (Python Data Analysis Library)**
*   **Purpose:** High-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools, especially for tabular data.
*   **Key Data Structures:**
    *   **`Series`:** 1D labeled array. Think of a single column.
        *   Creation: `pd.Series([list])`, `pd.Series(dictionary)`.
        *   Access: `s[index_position]` or `s[index_label]`.
    *   **`DataFrame`:** 2D labeled data structure (rows and columns). Think of a spreadsheet/table.
        *   Creation: `pd.DataFrame(dictionary_of_lists)`, `pd.DataFrame(list_of_dictionaries)`, `pd.DataFrame(numpy_array, columns=[...])`.
*   **DataFrame Inspection:**
    *   `df.head(n)`: First `n` rows.
    *   `df.tail(n)`: Last `n` rows.
    *   `df.info()`: Summary of DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts.
    *   `df.describe()`: Descriptive statistics for numerical columns (mean, std, min, max, quartiles).
    *   `df.shape`: Tuple of (rows, columns).
    *   `df.columns`: List of column names.
    *   `df.index`: List of row indices.
    *   `df.dtypes`: Series of data types for each column.
*   **DataFrame Selection & Filtering:**
    *   **Columns:**
        *   Single: `df['ColumnName']` (returns Series).
        *   Multiple: `df[['Col1', 'Col2']]` (returns DataFrame).
    *   **Rows & Columns:**
        *   `.loc[row_labels, col_labels]`: Label-based indexing (inclusive for slices).
        *   `.iloc[row_positions, col_positions]`: Integer-location based indexing (exclusive for slices).
    *   **Filtering (Boolean Indexing):** `df[df['Column'] > value]`.
        *   Combine conditions with `&` (AND), `|` (OR).
        *   `df['Column'].isin([list_of_values])`.
*   **Data Manipulation:**
    *   Adding Column: `df['New_Column'] = values`.
    *   Dropping Column: `df.drop(columns=['Col1', 'Col2'], inplace=False)`.
    *   Dropping Row: `df.drop(index=[idx1, idx2], inplace=False)`.
